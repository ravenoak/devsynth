Artifacts

Purpose
- Store versioned, reproducible evidence generated by release rehearsals and official tags (coverage summaries, HTML reports manifests, verification logs, checksums).

Canonical layout
- releases/<version>/<profile>/<timestamp>/
  - coverage.json
  - htmlcov/ (HTML coverage report for release snapshots only)
  - *.manifest.txt and corresponding *.sha256
  - verification logs (e.g., verify_requirements_traceability_*.txt) and .sha256
- research/
  - Research-related artefacts (e.g., MVUU overlay snapshots) organized by topic.
- scratch/ (gitignored)
  - Local, non-versioned working files.

Conventions
- <version>: semantic version or pre-release tag, e.g., 0.1.0a1
- <profile>: test profile or composition (e.g., fast-medium, full)
- <timestamp>: UTC in compact ISO8601 form, e.g., 20251003T173000Z
- File names should be descriptive and include profile/timestamp where relevant.
- Provide a plain-text manifest listing major generated paths; commit the manifest and its SHA-256.

Retention and commit policy
- Commit only textual artefacts, manifests, checksums, and official release HTML coverage under releases/*.
- Avoid committing large binaries; prefer linking to CI artifacts when not part of a release snapshot.
- Keep recent runs for active release cycles; prune older non-release folders when they are superseded.

Migration notes
- Existing top-level research artefacts (e.g., MVUU overlay files) should be grouped under `artifacts/research/` in a follow-up change to improve discoverability.
