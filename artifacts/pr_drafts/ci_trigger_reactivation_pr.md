# Re-enable GitHub Actions Triggers Post-v0.1.0a1

## Summary

This PR re-enables the standard GitHub Actions CI triggers (`push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`) now that v0.1.0a1 has been successfully tagged and released.

## Changes Made

### `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Re-enabled `push` trigger for `main` and `release/*` branches
- Re-enabled `pull_request` trigger for all branches
- Re-enabled `schedule` trigger for nightly builds (keeping existing schedule)
- Updated TODO comment to reflect completion

## Background

As per the release preparation guidelines in `docs/tasks.md` and `issues/re-enable-github-actions-triggers-post-v0-1-0a1.md`, GitHub Actions triggers were temporarily disabled during the v0.1.0a1 development cycle to prevent CI noise during alpha development.

Now that v0.1.0a1 has been tagged, it's appropriate to restore normal CI operation.

## Testing

- [x] CI workflow runs successfully on `workflow_dispatch` (current state)
- [x] No breaking changes to workflow configuration
- [x] All jobs and steps remain functional

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: This is a standard CI trigger restoration following established patterns
- **Mitigation**: If issues arise, triggers can be quickly disabled via repository settings
- **Monitoring**: First few runs should be monitored for any unexpected behavior

## Related Issues

- Closes `issues/re-enable-github-actions-triggers-post-v0-1-0a1.md`
- Resolves `docs/tasks.md` item 10.1

## Deployment Notes

- No production deployment impact
- CI will begin running on pushes/PRs immediately after merge
- Schedule-based runs will resume according to existing cron schedule
