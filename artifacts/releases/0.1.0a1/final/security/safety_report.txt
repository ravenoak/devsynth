[31m-> Vulnerability found in starlette version 0.46.2[0m
[1m   Vulnerability ID: [0m78279
[1m   Affected spec: [0m<0.47.2
[1m   ADVISORY: [0mStarlette is a lightweight ASGI (Asynchronous Server
   Gateway Interface) framework/toolkit, designed for building async web
   services in Python. In versions 0.47.1 and below, when parsing a multi-
   part form with large files (greater than the default max spool size)
   starlette will block the main thread to roll the file over to disk. This
   blocks the event thread which means the application can't accept new
   connections. The UploadFile code has a minor bug where instead of just
   checking for self._in_memory, the logic should also check if the
   additional bytes will cause a rollover. The vulnerability is fixed in
   version 0.47.2.
