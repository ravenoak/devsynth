DevSynth fast+medium regression attempt â€” 2025-09-30T16:20Z
Command: PYTHONPATH=src poetry run python -m pytest --collect-only -q
Outcome: FAILED during collection
Notes:
- pytest reported 409 collection errors caused by missing optional dependencies (numpy, GUI stacks, lmstudio providers).
- Numerous pytest markers (requires_resource, memory_intensive, gui) were unregistered because the full configuration
  extras were not installed in this environment.
- Coverage artifacts (test_reports/coverage.json, HTML reports) were not generated.
Next steps:
- Install the full test extras (`poetry install --with dev --extras tests retrieval chromadb api`) before rerunning
  `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --report --no-parallel`.
