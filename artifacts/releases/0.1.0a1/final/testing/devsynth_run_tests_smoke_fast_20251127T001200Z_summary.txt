Command: poetry run devsynth run-tests --smoke --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1

Outcome: Command hung in pytest collection with no coverage artifacts or knowledge-graph banner. After 4 minutes the pytest
process was still running as `/workspace/devsynth/.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ --collect-only -q -o addopts= -m fast and not memory_intensive`
and consuming CPU, so the run was interrupted manually with Ctrl+C.

Artifacts produced: none (.coverage absent, no manifests updated).
Follow-up: Track collection hang under docs/plan.md and issues/run-tests-fast-medium-collection-errors.md alongside existing behavior step regressions.
