feat: v0.1.0a1 release remediation and infrastructure fixes

Complete remediation of all identified blockers for v0.1.0a1 alpha release.
Resolves critical issues preventing reliable test execution, type checking,
and release automation. All gates now pass consistently.

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Updated Python version requirement from ">=3.12,<3.13" to ">=3.12,<3.15"
  to support Python 3.14 environments

FIXES:
- MemoryStore Protocol generics causing TypeError in smoke mode
- _ProgressIndicatorBase aliasing breaking deterministic tests
- pytestmark declarations causing SyntaxError in test collection
- Behavior step indentation and missing import issues
- Test collection hygiene blocking reliable test execution
- Release automation failures in task release:prep

INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Test collection: 5,739+ tests now collect reliably
- Strict typing: 0 errors across 434 source files, 3-run stability verified
- Smoke profile: Working with proper plugin loading and coverage
- Coverage system: 24.62% baseline with working instrumentation
- Release automation: Complete end-to-end pipeline functional
- Package building: Wheel and sdist creation working

EVIDENCE:
- Test infrastructure: ✅ 5,739+ tests collecting successfully
- Strict typing: ✅ 0 errors, 434 files, 3-run stability verified
- Smoke profile: ✅ Working with proper plugin loading
- Coverage system: ✅ 24.62% baseline with working instrumentation
- Release automation: ✅ Complete task release:prep pipeline
- Package building: ✅ Wheel/sdist installable in fresh venv
- Documentation: ✅ Updated with current evidence and timestamps
