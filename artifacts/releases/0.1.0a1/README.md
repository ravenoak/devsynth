# DevSynth 0.1.0a1 Release Evidence

This tree captures archival evidence that accompanies the 0.1.0a1 pre-release.
Subdirectories segment artifacts by the test speed combinations that generated
them.  Each speed bucket should document its retention rules locally and stay
ready to receive timestamped drops from CI and manual rehearsal runs.
