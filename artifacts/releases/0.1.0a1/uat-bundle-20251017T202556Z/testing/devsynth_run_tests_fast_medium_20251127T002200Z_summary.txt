Command: poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --report --no-parallel
Timestamp (UTC): 2025-10-06T21:46:00Z (invocation)
Log: logs/devsynth_run-tests_fast_medium_20251127T002200Z.log (no CLI output before interruption)
Outcome: Command produced no CLI output before stalling in pytest collection. After waiting several minutes the pytest collector
remained active without emitting knowledge-graph IDs, coverage manifests, or HTML/JSON artifacts. The process snapshot shows
the hung collector and indicates CPU usage during the stall; the run was terminated manually with Ctrl+C.

Artifacts produced: none (.coverage absent, coverage_manifest_latest.json unchanged).
Follow-up: Document the hang in docs/plan.md, docs/release/0.1.0-alpha.1.md, docs/tasks.md ยง13, and issues/run-tests-fast-medium-collection-errors.md for continued triage.
