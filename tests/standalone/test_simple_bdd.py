"""
This file has been moved to tests/behavior/steps/test_simple_addition_steps.py
as part of the test reorganization effort.

The test has been moved to the behavior tests directory because it is a BDD test
that uses pytest-bdd to run behavior-driven tests. The feature file it uses has
been moved to tests/behavior/features/examples/simple_addition.feature.

The new version of the test no longer dynamically creates the feature file, but
instead references the static feature file in the features directory, which is
the standard pattern for BDD tests in this project.
