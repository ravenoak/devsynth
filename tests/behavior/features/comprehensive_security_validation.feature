Feature: Comprehensive Security Validation Framework
  As a DevSynth developer
  I want enterprise-grade security auditing and validation
  So that the system maintains high security standards and compliance

  Background:
    Given the comprehensive security validation framework is configured
    And multi-layered security auditing is enabled
    And vulnerability management is active
    And compliance validation is operational
    And security enhancement engine is running

  @multi_layered_auditing @bandit_safety @high_priority
  Scenario: Perform multi-layered security auditing
    Given the security audit system is operational
    When comprehensive security analysis is executed
    Then Bandit static analysis should identify security issues
    And Safety dependency vulnerability scan should run
    And custom security validation checks should execute
    And comprehensive security report should be generated
    And security findings should be prioritized by severity
    And actionable remediation suggestions should be provided

  @vulnerability_management @risk_assessment @high_priority
  Scenario: Manage security vulnerabilities with prioritization
    Given security vulnerabilities are detected in the system
    When the vulnerability management engine processes them
    Then vulnerabilities should be scanned comprehensively
    And vulnerabilities should be prioritized by risk and impact
    And remediation plan should be generated automatically
    And vulnerability resolution should be tracked
    And progress reports should be provided regularly
    And risk mitigation should be optimized

  @compliance_validation @standards_adherence @medium_priority
  Scenario: Validate compliance with security standards
    Given security standards and policies are defined
    When compliance validation is performed
    Then security policies implementation should be validated
    And OWASP guidelines compliance should be checked
    And access controls should be validated thoroughly
    And encryption usage should be audited comprehensively
    And compliance reports should be generated
    And non-compliance issues should be flagged with remediation steps

  @security_enhancement @automated_improvement @medium_priority
  Scenario: Automatically enhance system security
    Given the security enhancement engine is active
    When security analysis and enhancement runs
    Then security gaps should be analyzed systematically
    And security improvement suggestions should be generated
    And safe security fixes should be applied automatically
    And security fixes should be validated for functionality
    And enhancement results should be documented
    And security posture should be measurably improved

  @agent_integration @security_tools @medium_priority
  Scenario: Provide security validation capabilities to agents
    Given agents need security validation tools
    When security validation tools are integrated with agents
    Then agents should be able to perform security scans
    And agents should receive security analysis results
    And agents should apply security fixes autonomously
    And security-aware decision making should be enabled
    And security validation should be part of agent workflows

  @real_time_monitoring @continuous_assessment @low_priority
  Scenario: Perform real-time security monitoring
    Given the system is running with security monitoring enabled
    When code changes occur during development
    Then real-time security assessment should happen
    And security alerts should be generated for issues
    And security metrics should be tracked continuously
    And security trends should be analyzed
    And predictive threat detection should work
    And monitoring should not significantly impact performance

  @trend_analysis @predictive_detection @low_priority
  Scenario: Analyze security trends with predictive capabilities
    Given historical security data is available
    When security trend analysis is performed
    Then security metrics should be analyzed over time
    And security trends should be identified and reported
    And predictive threat detection should forecast issues
    And security recommendations should be generated proactively
    And risk assessments should inform development decisions
    And security improvements should be prioritized based on trends

  @policy_enforcement @security_standards @low_priority
  Scenario: Enforce security policies across the system
    Given security policies are defined and active
    When policy enforcement mechanisms are triggered
    Then security policies should be validated continuously
    And policy violations should be detected and reported
    And automated remediation should occur where possible
    And policy compliance should be tracked and reported
    And security governance should be maintained
    And audit trails should be generated for compliance

  @vulnerability_tracking @resolution_workflow @low_priority
  Scenario: Track vulnerability resolution through complete workflow
    Given a security vulnerability is identified
    When the vulnerability resolution workflow executes
    Then vulnerability should be documented with full context
    And impact assessment should be performed
    And remediation steps should be defined and prioritized
    And fix implementation should be tracked
    And validation testing should confirm resolution
    And resolution should be documented and verified
    And lessons learned should be captured for future prevention

  @security_integration @ci_cd_pipeline @low_priority
  Scenario: Integrate security validation into CI/CD pipeline
    Given CI/CD pipeline is configured with security validation
    When code changes are submitted for integration
    Then automated security scans should run as part of pipeline
    And security gates should prevent insecure code from merging
    And security reports should be generated and stored
    And security metrics should be tracked over time
    And security feedback should be provided to developers
    And security standards should be enforced automatically
