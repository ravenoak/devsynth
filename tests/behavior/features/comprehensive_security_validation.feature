Feature: Comprehensive Security Validation
  As a developer
  I want comprehensive security validation
  So that I can ensure my code meets security standards

  Background:
    Given the DevSynth system is initialized
    And the comprehensive security validation framework is configured
    And I have a project with security requirements

  @medium @security
  Scenario: Run comprehensive security audit
    When I run a comprehensive security audit
    Then the system should run Bandit static analysis
    And the system should scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
    And the system should validate security policies
    And the system should generate a comprehensive security report

  @fast @security
  Scenario: Manage security vulnerabilities
    Given I have vulnerabilities in my project
    When I scan for security vulnerabilities
    Then the system should identify all vulnerabilities
    And the system should prioritize vulnerabilities by risk
    And the system should generate a remediation plan
    And the system should track vulnerability resolution

  @fast @security
  Scenario: Validate security compliance
    Given I have security compliance requirements
    When I validate security compliance
    Then the system should check OWASP compliance
    And the system should validate access controls
    And the system should audit encryption usage
    And the system should generate compliance report

  @medium @security
  Scenario: Enhance security automatically
    Given I have security gaps in my code
    When I run security enhancement
    Then the system should identify security improvements
    And the system should apply safe security fixes
    And the system should validate fixes don't break functionality
    And the system should report security improvements

  @fast @security
  Scenario: Monitor security continuously
    Given security monitoring is enabled
    When code changes are made
    Then the system should detect security impacts
    And the system should generate security alerts
    And the system should suggest security improvements
    And the system should track security trends

  @fast @security
  Scenario: Validate input validation security
    Given I have user input handling code
    When I validate input validation security
    Then the system should check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
    And the system should check for XSS vulnerabilities
    And the system should validate input sanitization
    And the system should report validation issues

  @fast @security
  Scenario: Audit authentication mechanisms
    Given I have authentication code in my project
    When I audit authentication mechanisms
    Then the system should validate password policies
    And the system should check session management
    And the system should verify token handling
    And the system should report authentication issues

  @medium @security
  Scenario: Integrate with EDRR workflow
    Given the EDRR workflow is configured
    When I initiate a security validation task
    Then the system should use threat analysis in the Analysis phase
    And the system should use vulnerability assessment in the Design phase
    And the system should use security enhancement in the Refinement phase
    And the memory system should store security validation results

  @fast @security
  Scenario: Generate security improvement suggestions
    Given I have security analysis results
    When I request security improvement suggestions
    Then the system should prioritize suggestions by risk
    And the system should provide implementation guidance
    And the system should estimate remediation effort
    And the system should predict security improvement outcomes

  @slow @security
  Scenario: Performance validation for large projects
    Given I have a large project with complex security requirements
    When I run comprehensive security validation
    Then security audit should complete within performance targets
    And vulnerability scanning should complete within targets
    And compliance validation should complete within targets
    And resource usage should remain within specified limits
