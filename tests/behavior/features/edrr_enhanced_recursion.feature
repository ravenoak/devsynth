Feature: Enhanced EDRR Recursion Handling
  As a developer
  I want enhanced recursion handling in the EDRR framework
  So that complex tasks can be broken down and processed more effectively

  Background:
    Given the EDRR coordinator is initialized with enhanced recursion features
    And the memory system is available
    And the WSDE team is available
    And the AST analyzer is available
    And the prompt manager is available
    And the documentation manager is available

  Scenario: Improved micro-cycle creation with intelligent task decomposition
    Given a complex task that requires decomposition
    When the coordinator determines that recursion is needed
    Then the coordinator should intelligently decompose the task into subtasks
    And each subtask should have clear boundaries and objectives
    And the subtasks should collectively cover the entire original task
    And the subtasks should be prioritized based on dependencies
    And the coordinator should create micro-cycles for each subtask
    And each micro-cycle should have appropriate context from the parent cycle

  Scenario: Optimized recursion depth decisions with advanced heuristics
    Given a task that might require multiple levels of recursion
    When the coordinator evaluates whether to create nested micro-cycles
    Then the coordinator should apply advanced heuristics to determine optimal recursion depth
    And the heuristics should consider task complexity
    And the heuristics should consider available resources
    And the heuristics should consider historical performance data
    And the heuristics should consider diminishing returns at deeper recursion levels
    And the coordinator should limit recursion to the optimal depth

  Scenario: Enhanced result aggregation from recursive cycles
    Given multiple micro-cycles have completed processing subtasks
    When the coordinator aggregates results from these micro-cycles
    Then the aggregation should intelligently merge similar results
    And the aggregation should resolve conflicts between contradictory results
    And the aggregation should preserve unique insights from each micro-cycle
    And the aggregation should prioritize higher quality results
    And the aggregated result should be more comprehensive than any individual micro-cycle result
    And the aggregation metadata should include provenance information

  Scenario: Adaptive recursion strategy based on task type
    Given different types of tasks with varying characteristics
    When the coordinator processes these tasks
    Then the recursion strategy should adapt to the task type
    And code-related tasks should use AST-based decomposition
    And research-related tasks should use topic-based decomposition
    And design-related tasks should use component-based decomposition
    And the coordinator should select the appropriate decomposition strategy automatically

  Scenario: Recursion with comprehensive progress tracking
    Given a task that has been decomposed into multiple subtasks
    When the coordinator creates and executes micro-cycles for these subtasks
    Then the coordinator should track progress across all recursion levels
    And the progress tracking should show completion percentage for each subtask
    And the progress tracking should aggregate completion status up the recursion hierarchy
    And the progress tracking should identify bottlenecks in the recursion tree
    And the progress tracking should be accessible through the coordinator's API
