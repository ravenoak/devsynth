Feature: Enhanced GraphRAG Multi-Hop Reasoning and Semantic Linking
  As a DevSynth developer
  I want GraphRAG to perform complex multi-hop reasoning with semantic linking
  So that agents can understand code purpose and business context, not just implementation

  Background:
    Given the enhanced GraphRAG system is configured with multi-hop reasoning
    And a comprehensive knowledge graph with requirements, code, tests, and documentation
    And semantic linking is enabled and trained
    And the system has access to execution learning insights

  @multi_hop_traceability @research_validated @high_priority
  Scenario: Trace requirement through complete implementation chain
    Given a business requirement with ID "REQ-001" that states "Users must be able to authenticate using email and password"
    And the requirement is implemented across multiple functions including login, password validation, and session management
    And validated by unit tests, integration tests, and security tests
    When I ask "What code implements requirement REQ-001 and how is it tested?"
    Then the system should traverse multiple hops correctly:
      | Hop | Expected Traversal | Accuracy Requirement |
      | 1 | Requirement → Implementing Functions | >95% |
      | 2 | Functions → Test Cases | >90% |
      | 3 | Tests → Security Requirements | >85% |
      | 4 | Requirements → Business Value | >80% |
    And identify all implementing functions with >95% accuracy
    And find all validating tests with >90% accuracy
    And provide complete traceability path from business need to implementation
    And explain the reasoning steps taken with confidence scores >0.8

  @impact_analysis @blast_radius @medium_priority
  Scenario: Calculate accurate blast radius for proposed changes
    Given a proposed change to modify the authentication API signature
    And the API is used by 15 different modules across the application
    And affects 3 business requirements and 8 security policies
    When I ask "What would be affected if I change this API signature?"
    Then the system should calculate the complete blast radius using multi-hop traversal
    And identify all dependent functions, tests, and requirements with >90% completeness
    And assess the risk level as "High" due to security implications
    And suggest mitigation strategies including staged rollout and feature flags
    And provide effort estimation within 20% of actual development time

  @semantic_linking @meaning_barrier @high_priority
  Scenario: Bridge meaning barrier with semantic linking
    Given code comments and commit messages contain business intent like "Implement secure login for user dashboard access"
    And requirements describe business needs like "Users need secure access to personal data"
    And test cases validate security requirements
    When the system analyzes semantic relationships using execution learning insights
    Then it should link code to business requirements with >80% accuracy
    And identify intent-implementation alignment issues where they exist
    And suggest improvements for unclear code intent with specific recommendations
    And maintain semantic links during code evolution and refactoring

  @complex_query @research_backed @high_priority
  Scenario: Handle complex multi-hop queries with semantic understanding
    Given a complex query: "Which requirements are affected by changes to the payment processing module that handles credit card transactions?"
    When the system processes this through multi-hop reasoning
    Then it should correctly traverse:
      | Traversal Path | Expected Entities | Reasoning Quality |
      | Payment Module → Functions | Direct implementation | >95% |
      | Functions → Tests | Validation chain | >90% |
      | Tests → Requirements | Business rules | >85% |
      | Requirements → Security Policies | Compliance | >80% |
      | Security → Business Impact | Risk assessment | >75% |
    And provide a comprehensive answer with traceability
    And include confidence scores for each reasoning step
    And highlight any gaps or uncertainties in the analysis

  @integration @enhanced_ctm @medium_priority
  Scenario: Integration with enhanced CTM improves reasoning quality
    Given the GraphRAG system is integrated with enhanced CTM execution learning
    And the CTM has learned semantic patterns from code execution trajectories
    When processing queries about code behavior
    Then the system should use execution insights to improve traversal accuracy by >30%
    And provide more accurate semantic linking between requirements and implementation
    And detect functional equivalence between different code implementations
    And explain behavioral differences with execution-based evidence

  @validation_framework @research_backed @critical
  Scenario: Research-backed validation confirms multi-hop improvements
    Given an enhanced GraphRAG system with multi-hop reasoning and semantic linking
    And a baseline GraphRAG system without these enhancements
    And a test suite of complex multi-hop queries from research benchmarks
    When both systems process the same queries
    Then the enhanced system should show >30% improvement in answer accuracy
    And provide more complete reasoning paths with >5 hops on average
    And maintain higher confidence scores >0.8 for complex queries
    And demonstrate better handling of semantic ambiguity and intent understanding
    And achieve >85% accuracy on meaning barrier bridging tasks

  @performance @scalability @medium_priority
  Scenario: Enhanced GraphRAG scales with large knowledge graphs
    Given a knowledge graph with 10000+ entities and 50000+ relationships
    And complex multi-hop queries requiring 7+ traversal steps
    When the system processes queries under load
    Then it should complete traversals within 2 seconds for typical queries
    And maintain <1GB additional memory usage for reasoning
    And provide accurate results for 95% of semantic linking operations
    And handle incremental graph updates without full reprocessing

  @backward_compatibility @integration @critical
  Scenario: Enhanced GraphRAG maintains compatibility with existing functionality
    Given the existing GraphRAG system is working correctly
    When enhanced multi-hop reasoning features are enabled
    Then all existing GraphRAG operations should continue to work unchanged
    And performance degradation should be <15% for simple queries
    And memory usage should remain within acceptable limits
    And fallback to baseline GraphRAG should work when enhanced features are disabled
