Feature: Automated Quality Assurance
  As a developer
  I want automated quality assurance
  So that I can maintain high code quality without manual effort

  Background:
    Given the DevSynth system is initialized
    And the automated quality assurance engine is configured
    And I have a project with specifications, code, and tests

  @fast @quality-assurance
  Scenario: Run dialectical audit
    When I run a dialectical audit
    Then the system should cross-reference documentation, code, and tests
    And the system should identify inconsistencies
    And the system should generate questions for review
    And the system should log audit results

  @fast @quality-assurance
  Scenario: Verify requirements traceability
    Given I have a requirements traceability matrix
    When I verify requirements traceability
    Then the system should validate all requirement references
    And the system should check specification links exist
    And the system should verify BDD feature references
    And the system should report any missing links

  @medium @quality-assurance
  Scenario: Enhance code quality automatically
    Given I have code with potential improvements
    When I run quality enhancement
    Then the system should identify improvement opportunities
    And the system should apply safe enhancements
    And the system should preserve functionality
    And the system should report changes made

  @fast @quality-assurance
  Scenario: Generate comprehensive quality report
    Given I have quality assurance results
    When I generate a comprehensive quality report
    Then the report should include audit findings
    And the report should show traceability status
    And the report should list improvements made
    And the report should provide quality metrics

  @fast @quality-assurance
  Scenario: Validate specification completeness
    Given I have project specifications
    When I validate specification completeness
    Then the system should check for required sections
    And the system should verify cross-references
    And the system should validate formatting
    And the system should report completeness percentage

  @medium @quality-assurance
  Scenario: Monitor quality continuously
    Given quality monitoring is enabled
    When code changes are made
    Then the system should detect quality impacts
    And the system should generate alerts for issues
    And the system should suggest improvements
    And the system should track quality trends

  @fast @quality-assurance
  Scenario: Validate BDD feature consistency
    When I validate BDD feature consistency
    Then the system should check feature file syntax
    And the system should verify step definitions exist
    And the system should validate scenario structure
    And the system should report consistency issues

  @medium @quality-assurance
  Scenario: Integrate with EDRR workflow
    Given the EDRR workflow is configured
    When I initiate a quality assurance task
    Then the system should use audit analysis in the Analysis phase
    And the system should use traceability verification in the Design phase
    And the system should use automated enhancement in the Refinement phase
    And the memory system should store quality assurance results

  @fast @quality-assurance
  Scenario: Generate quality improvement suggestions
    Given I have quality analysis results
    When I request improvement suggestions
    Then the system should prioritize suggestions by impact
    And the system should provide implementation guidance
    And the system should estimate effort required
    And the system should predict improvement outcomes

  @slow @quality-assurance
  Scenario: Performance validation for large projects
    Given I have a large project with complex requirements
    When I run comprehensive quality assurance
    Then audit operations should complete within performance targets
    And traceability verification should complete within targets
    And enhancement operations should complete within targets
    And resource usage should remain within specified limits
