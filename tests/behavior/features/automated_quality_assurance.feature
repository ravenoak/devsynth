Feature: Automated Quality Assurance Engine
  As a DevSynth developer
  I want comprehensive automated quality monitoring and improvement
  So that the system maintains high standards without manual intervention

  Background:
    Given the automated quality assurance engine is configured
    And dialectical audit system is active
    And requirements traceability engine is operational
    And quality enhancement system is enabled
    And comprehensive validation is running

  @dialectical_audit @cross_referencing @high_priority
  Scenario: Perform dialectical audit across docs, code, and tests
    Given the system has documentation, code, and test files
    When the dialectical audit system processes all components
    Then feature references should be extracted from documentation
    And feature references should be extracted from test files
    And feature references should be extracted from code comments
    And audit questions should be generated for inconsistencies
    And audit results should be logged for review
    And conflicts should be identified and flagged

  @requirements_traceability @matrix_validation @high_priority
  Scenario: Validate requirements traceability matrix
    Given a requirements traceability matrix exists
    And specification files are present
    When the requirements traceability engine validates the matrix
    Then code references in requirements should be verified
    And test references in requirements should be checked
    And specification links should exist and be valid
    And BDD feature files should be properly referenced
    And traceability completeness should be calculated
    And gaps in traceability should be identified

  @quality_enhancement @automated_improvement @medium_priority
  Scenario: Automatically enhance system quality
    Given the quality enhancement system is active
    When quality enhancements are triggered
    Then common code quality issues should be fixed
    And documentation completeness should be improved
    And code organization should be enhanced
    And validation should be strengthened
    And error handling should be improved
    And enhancement results should be reported

  @comprehensive_validation @system_validation @medium_priority
  Scenario: Perform comprehensive validation of all components
    Given all system components are available for validation
    When comprehensive validation is executed
    Then specifications should be validated for completeness
    And BDD feature files should be validated for structure
    And test coverage should meet requirements
    And requirements traceability should be verified
    And code quality standards should be enforced
    And validation reports should be generated

  @continuous_monitoring @real_time_feedback @medium_priority
  Scenario: Provide continuous quality monitoring
    Given the system is running with quality monitoring enabled
    When code changes are made during development
    Then real-time quality feedback should be provided
    And quality metrics should be tracked continuously
    And alerts should be generated for quality degradation
    And improvement suggestions should be offered
    And monitoring should not impact performance significantly

  @dialectical_questions @conflict_resolution @low_priority
  Scenario: Generate and resolve dialectical audit questions
    Given conflicting information exists across components
    When dialectical audit questions are generated
    Then questions should highlight inconsistencies
    And questions should require specific resolution
    And audit results should be properly logged
    And resolution status should be tracked
    And conflicts should be resolved systematically

  @specification_validation @completeness_check @low_priority
  Scenario: Validate specification completeness and consistency
    Given specification files exist in the system
    When specification validation runs
    Then required metadata should be present
    And specification structure should be consistent
    And references to other components should be valid
    And acceptance criteria should be defined
    And implementation details should be specified
    And validation results should be comprehensive

  @bdd_feature_validation @test_structure @low_priority
  Scenario: Validate BDD feature file structure and content
    Given BDD feature files exist in the test suite
    When BDD feature validation executes
    Then feature files should follow Gherkin syntax
    And scenarios should have proper Given-When-Then structure
    And tags should be appropriately applied
    And step definitions should be implemented
    And scenarios should align with specifications
    And test coverage should be adequate

  @test_coverage_validation @quality_metrics @low_priority
  Scenario: Validate test coverage meets requirements
    Given test coverage data is available
    When test coverage validation runs
    Then coverage percentage should meet minimum thresholds
    And critical code paths should be covered
    And edge cases should be tested
    And coverage gaps should be identified
    And coverage improvement suggestions should be provided
    And coverage reports should be generated

  @code_quality_enforcement @standards_compliance @low_priority
  Scenario: Enforce code quality standards
    Given code quality standards are defined
    When code quality enforcement runs
    Then code style guidelines should be followed
    And complexity metrics should be within limits
    And security best practices should be applied
    And performance standards should be met
    And maintainability scores should be acceptable
    And quality violations should be reported

  @trend_analysis @predictive_capabilities @low_priority
  Scenario: Perform quality trend analysis with predictions
    Given historical quality data is available
    When trend analysis is performed
    Then quality metrics should be analyzed over time
    And trends should be identified and reported
    And predictive capabilities should forecast issues
    And improvement recommendations should be generated
    And risk assessments should be provided
    And analysis should inform development decisions
