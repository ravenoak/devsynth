Feature: Multi-Disciplinary Dialectical Reasoning
  As a developer
  I want to apply multi-disciplinary dialectical reasoning to proposed solutions
  So that I can create better solutions that balance multiple perspectives

  Background:
    Given the DevSynth system is initialized
    And a WSDE team is created with multiple disciplinary agents

  Scenario: Apply multi-disciplinary dialectical reasoning to a proposed solution
    Given a task requiring multiple disciplinary perspectives
    And a proposed solution for the task
    And knowledge sources from multiple disciplines
    When multi-disciplinary dialectical reasoning is applied
    Then the result should contain the original thesis
    And the result should contain perspectives from multiple disciplines
    And the result should contain a synthesis that integrates multiple perspectives
    And the result should contain an evaluation from multiple perspectives
    And the synthesis should address conflicts between perspectives
    And the synthesis should be an improvement over the original solution

  Scenario: Handle conflicts between security and user experience perspectives
    Given a task requiring security and user experience considerations
    And a proposed solution for the task
    And knowledge sources for security and user experience
    When multi-disciplinary dialectical reasoning is applied
    Then the result should identify conflicts between security and user experience
    And the synthesis should resolve conflicts between security and user experience
    And the evaluation should assess the solution from both security and user experience perspectives

  Scenario: Handle conflicts between performance and accessibility perspectives
    Given a task requiring performance and accessibility considerations
    And a proposed solution for the task
    And knowledge sources for performance and accessibility
    When multi-disciplinary dialectical reasoning is applied
    Then the result should identify conflicts between performance and accessibility
    And the synthesis should resolve conflicts between performance and accessibility
    And the evaluation should assess the solution from both performance and accessibility perspectives

  Scenario: Integrate perspectives from four different disciplines
    Given a task requiring security, user experience, performance, and accessibility considerations
    And a proposed solution for the task
    And knowledge sources for all four disciplines
    When multi-disciplinary dialectical reasoning is applied
    Then the result should contain perspectives from all four disciplines
    And the synthesis should integrate recommendations from all four disciplines
    And the evaluation should assess the solution from all four perspectives
    And the overall assessment should reflect the balance of all perspectives
