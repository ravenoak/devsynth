Feature: Enhanced CTM with Execution Trajectory Learning
  As a DevSynth developer
  I want the CTM to learn from execution trajectories
  So that agents understand code behavior, not just syntax patterns

  Background:
    Given the enhanced CTM system is configured with execution learning
    And a trained execution understanding model is available
    And semantic validation tests are enabled
    And the system has access to a code execution sandbox

  @semantic_robustness @research_validated @high_priority
  Scenario: Agent maintains understanding through semantic-preserving mutations
    Given I have a function that calculates fibonacci numbers
    And the agent correctly understands the original function with >95% accuracy
    When I rename all variables in the function to non-descriptive names
    And add misleading comments that contradict the code logic
    And insert unreachable dead code
    And reorder function definitions within the file
    Then the agent should still understand the function's behavior
    And maintain >90% understanding accuracy on comprehension questions
    And provide correct answers to questions about:
      | Question | Expected Accuracy |
      | What does this code do? | >95% |
      | What are the inputs and outputs? | >90% |
      | What happens with input X? | >85% |
      | What are the edge cases? | >80% |
      | How does it handle errors? | >85% |

  @execution_learning @trajectory_based @medium_priority
  Scenario: Agent learns from execution trajectories
    Given I provide multiple code snippets with their execution traces
    When the CTM processes the trajectories using the learning algorithm
    Then it should learn behavioral patterns from the execution data
    And predict execution outcomes for similar code patterns
    And achieve >80% prediction accuracy on validation trajectories
    And maintain prediction confidence scores >0.7

  @semantic_equivalence @pattern_recognition @medium_priority
  Scenario: Agent detects semantic equivalence despite surface differences
    Given two code snippets that are functionally identical
    But have different variable names, formatting, and comments
    When the agent analyzes both snippets using execution learning
    Then it should detect they are semantically equivalent
    And assign a similarity score >0.9
    And identify the same behavioral patterns in both
    And predict identical execution outcomes

  @multi_hop_reasoning @graph_enhanced @high_priority
  Scenario: Agent performs multi-hop reasoning with execution understanding
    Given the agent has execution understanding capabilities
    And a knowledge graph with code relationships and requirements
    When asked "What requirements are implemented by functions that depend on this deprecated API?"
    Then it should traverse the graph correctly through multiple hops
    And provide accurate traceability information
    And explain the reasoning path taken step by step
    And identify all affected components with >90% accuracy

  @learning_consolidation @memory_integration @medium_priority
  Scenario: CTM consolidates execution learning into semantic knowledge
    Given the agent has processed multiple execution trajectories
    When the consolidation process runs on the episodic buffer
    Then it should extract semantic patterns from the trajectories
    And create semantic units representing learned behaviors
    And link execution patterns to existing code entities in the graph
    And improve future retrieval accuracy by >30%

  @validation_framework @research_backed @high_priority
  Scenario: Research-backed validation confirms genuine understanding improvements
    Given an agent with enhanced CTM execution learning
    And a baseline agent with standard CTM
    And a test suite of semantic-preserving mutations
    When both agents are tested on understanding tasks
    Then the enhanced agent should show >40% improvement in understanding scores
    And maintain >90% accuracy through semantic mutations
    And demonstrate better multi-hop reasoning capabilities
    And provide more accurate execution predictions

  @integration @backward_compatibility @critical
  Scenario: Enhanced CTM integrates without breaking existing functionality
    Given the existing CTM system is working correctly
    When enhanced execution learning features are enabled
    Then all existing CTM operations should continue to work unchanged
    And performance degradation should be <10%
    And memory usage should remain within acceptable limits
    And fallback to baseline CTM should work when enhanced features fail

  @performance @scalability @medium_priority
  Scenario: Enhanced CTM handles large codebases efficiently
    Given a project with 1000+ functions and complex dependencies
    When the execution learning system processes the codebase
    Then it should complete trajectory collection within 5 minutes
    And maintain <2GB memory usage during processing
    And provide accurate semantic understanding for 95% of functions
    And handle incremental updates without full reprocessing
