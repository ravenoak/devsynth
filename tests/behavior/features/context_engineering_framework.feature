Feature: Context Engineering Framework Specification
  As a DevSynth developer
  I want sophisticated context management and optimization
  So that agents can effectively handle long-horizon tasks with finite attention budgets

  Background:
    Given the context engineering framework is configured
    And RAG+ integration is enabled
    And compression strategies are available
    And agentic memory management is active
    And hierarchical context architecture is operational

  @attention_budget_management @finite_resources @high_priority
  Scenario: Optimize context as finite resource with attention budget
    Given agents have limited attention budgets for context
    When context engineering manages finite resources
    Then context utility should be optimized over size maximization
    And signal-to-noise ratio should be actively curated
    And diminishing returns should be accounted for
    And high-signal tokens should be prioritized
    And resource allocation should be efficient

  @hierarchical_context @context_layers @high_priority
  Scenario: Implement hierarchical context architecture
    Given the system needs to manage different context types
    When hierarchical context stack is utilized
    Then global/static context should contain system prompts and persona
    And dynamic/task context should include current query and tool outputs
    And episodic context should maintain conversation history
    And context layers should be clearly delineated
    And context flow should be optimized between layers

  @rag_plus_integration @dual_corpus @medium_priority
  Scenario: Integrate RAG+ with dual corpus architecture
    Given the system has knowledge and application examples
    When RAG+ performs joint retrieval
    Then knowledge corpus should provide declarative facts
    And application examples corpus should demonstrate knowledge application
    And both knowledge and examples should be retrieved during inference
    And procedural guidance should be provided to LLMs
    And domain-specific enhancement should work for specialized tasks

  @compression_strategies @sac_compression @medium_priority
  Scenario: Apply semantic-anchor compression techniques
    Given context needs to be compressed for efficiency
    When SAC compression is applied
    Then existing tokens should be selected as semantic anchors
    And autoencoding-free approach should avoid reconstruction mismatch
    And semantic integrity should be maintained during compression
    And token count should be reduced significantly
    And high-fidelity preservation should be achieved

  @agentic_memory_techniques @compaction @medium_priority
  Scenario: Enable agentic memory compaction techniques
    Given agents need to manage conversation history
    When agentic memory techniques are applied
    Then periodic summarization should condense conversation history
    And essential information should be preserved during compaction
    And working memory should be reset with summaries
    And context quality should be maintained
    And memory efficiency should be improved

  @structured_note_taking @external_memory @low_priority
  Scenario: Implement structured note-taking for agents
    Given agents need to track important information externally
    When structured note-taking is utilized
    Then agentic scratchpad should be created for task tracking
    And strategic recording should decide what to externalize
    And seamless retrieval should be available during tasks
    And memory organization should be improved
    And information continuity should be maintained

  @sub_agent_architectures @task_decomposition @low_priority
  Scenario: Use sub-agent architectures for complex tasks
    Given complex tasks require hierarchical decomposition
    When sub-agent architectures are employed
    Then complex problems should be broken into specialized subtasks
    And manager agents should coordinate worker agents
    And clean context boundaries should be maintained
    And task execution should be more efficient
    And hierarchical execution should work correctly

  @ace_framework @self_evolution @low_priority
  Scenario: Enable ACE framework for context self-evolution
    Given agents need to refine their own context
    When ACE framework is operational
    Then agents should modify prompts based on execution feedback
    And iterative improvement should occur autonomously
    And performance self-assessment should work
    And context quality should improve over time
    And cognitive environment should be optimized

  @a_mem_organization @autonomous_structure @low_priority
  Scenario: Implement A-Mem for autonomous memory organization
    Given agents need to organize memory without predefined schemas
    When A-Mem system is active
    Then agents should create meaningful memory links autonomously
    And organic knowledge graphs should emerge from task relevance
    And contextual descriptions should be self-generated
    And memory organization should adapt to usage patterns
    And retrieval accuracy should improve

  @edrr_integration @context_engineering @medium_priority
  Scenario: Integrate context engineering with EDRR framework
    Given EDRR cycles need context engineering support
    When context engineering enhances EDRR phases
    Then expand phase should use RAG+ for diverse examples
    And differentiate phase should use graph store for relationship analysis
    And refine phase should apply compression and summarization
    And retrospect phase should utilize agentic memory for learning
    And overall reasoning quality should improve

  @wsde_enhancement @agent_roles @low_priority
  Scenario: Enhance WSDE model with context engineering
    Given WSDE agents need context-aware capabilities
    When context engineering enhances WSDE roles
    Then Primus should have full access to context engineering stack
    And Worker agents should have focused optimized context windows
    And Supervisor should integrate quality metrics with context utility
    And Designer should access application examples and reasoning patterns
    And Evaluator should use context-aware evaluation with compression

  @quality_metrics @context_utility @low_priority
  Scenario: Track context utility and performance metrics
    Given context engineering needs quality measurement
    When quality metrics are tracked
    Then signal-to-noise ratio should be measured and optimized
    And retrieval precision should be monitored and improved
    And compression fidelity should be validated
    And agentic performance should be assessed
    And context management effectiveness should be quantified
