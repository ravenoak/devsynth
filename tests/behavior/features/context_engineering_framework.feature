Feature: Context Engineering Framework
    As a DevSynth agent
    I want to optimize my context management
    So that I can effectively handle complex, long-horizon tasks

    @fast @context-engineering
    Scenario: Agent optimizes context for task complexity
        Given an agent with context engineering capabilities
        When presented with a complex multi-step task
        Then it should assess the attention budget requirements
        And retrieve both knowledge and application examples via RAG+
        And compress context if exceeding budget limits
        And structure information in hierarchical layers

    @fast @rag-plus
    Scenario: RAG+ dual corpus retrieval
        Given a knowledge corpus with technical documentation
        And an application examples corpus with worked solutions
        When processing a complex reasoning query
        Then the system should retrieve relevant factual information
        And retrieve corresponding procedural examples
        And present both knowledge and application guidance together

    @medium @compression
    Scenario: Semantic-Anchor Compression maintains fidelity
        Given a long context document exceeding token limits
        When applying Semantic-Anchor Compression
        Then it should select key tokens as anchors
        And aggregate contextual information without autoencoding
        And maintain >95% semantic fidelity
        And achieve target compression ratio

    @fast @hierarchical-context
    Scenario: Hierarchical context stack organization
        Given task context with global, dynamic, and episodic components
        When building the hierarchical context stack
        Then global context should be at the base layer
        And dynamic task context should be in the middle layer
        And episodic conversation history should be at the top layer
        And each layer should be clearly delineated

    @medium @agentic-memory
    Scenario: Agent performs context compaction
        Given an agent engaged in a long-running conversation
        When context length approaches budget limits
        Then it should autonomously summarize conversation history
        And preserve critical decisions and architectural choices
        And reset working context with the compacted summary
        And maintain task continuity

    @medium @structured-note-taking
    Scenario: Agent uses structured note-taking
        Given an agent working on a complex multi-step task
        When encountering important intermediate results
        Then it should autonomously decide to externalize key information
        And store notes in the agentic scratchpad
        And retrieve notes when needed for task completion
        And track progress and dependencies across steps

    @slow @sub-agent-architecture
    Scenario: Sub-agent decomposition for complex tasks
        Given a highly complex task requiring diverse expertise
        When the primary agent assesses task complexity
        Then it should decompose the task into specialized sub-tasks
        And delegate each sub-task to focused sub-agents
        And provide each sub-agent with clean, relevant context
        And synthesize results from all sub-agents
        And return only distilled findings to maintain context cleanliness

    @fast @attention-budget
    Scenario: Attention budget tracking and optimization
        Given an agent with defined attention budget limits
        When processing information streams
        Then it should track token utilization
        And prioritize high-signal content
        And filter noise and irrelevant information
        And optimize context composition for task requirements

    @medium @context-self-evolution
    Scenario: Agent evolves its own context templates
        Given an agent with context self-evolution capabilities
        When completing multiple iterations of similar tasks
        Then it should analyze performance feedback
        And identify patterns in successful context configurations
        And refine its context templates autonomously
        And improve performance on subsequent tasks

    @slow @long-horizon-coherence
    Scenario: Maintaining coherence in extended sessions
        Given an agent engaged in a multi-hour development session
        When processing numerous related tasks over time
        Then it should maintain consistent understanding across tasks
        And prevent context pollution from accumulating noise
        And adapt context strategy based on session progress
        And preserve critical architectural decisions throughout
