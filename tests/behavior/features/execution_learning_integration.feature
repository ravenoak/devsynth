Feature: Execution Learning Integration with Enhanced Memory System
  As a DevSynth developer
  I want execution trajectory learning integrated with the memory system
  So that agents can learn from code execution patterns and improve understanding

  Background:
    Given the execution learning integration is configured and initialized
    And the memory system is enhanced with Memetic Units
    And the enhanced knowledge graph is available
    And learning algorithms are ready for training

  @execution_trajectory_collection @trajectory_analysis @high_priority
  Scenario: Collect and analyze execution trajectories from code snippets
    Given I have multiple Python code snippets to analyze
    And the execution trajectory collector is configured
    When I collect execution trajectories from the code snippets
    Then trajectories should be captured with execution steps and outcomes
    And memory states should be recorded at key points
    And variable changes should be tracked throughout execution
    And function call sequences should be documented
    And execution time should be measured and categorized

  @pattern_extraction @behavioral_learning @high_priority
  Scenario: Extract and learn behavioral patterns from execution trajectories
    Given I have collected execution trajectories from various code
    And the learning algorithm is configured with pattern detection
    When I extract patterns from the trajectories
    Then function call patterns should be identified and categorized
    And variable lifecycle patterns should be analyzed
    And error handling patterns should be detected
    And performance patterns should be classified
    And pattern confidence should be calculated based on frequency and consistency

  @semantic_understanding @execution_based @critical
  Scenario: Build semantic understanding from execution patterns
    Given I have learned behavioral patterns from execution trajectories
    And the semantic understanding engine is configured
    When I analyze code for semantic components and behavioral intent
    Then structural analysis should identify code organization patterns
    And data flow patterns should reveal variable dependencies
    And behavioral intentions should be extracted from execution context
    And execution outcome mappings should be generated
    And semantic fingerprints should uniquely identify code behavior

  @memetic_unit_integration @cognitive_processing @medium_priority
  Scenario: Create Memetic Units from execution learning results
    Given I have execution trajectories and learned patterns
    And the Memetic Unit ingestion pipeline is configured
    When I create Memetic Units from the learning results
    Then episodic units should capture execution experiences
    And semantic units should represent learned patterns
    And procedural units should contain executable knowledge
    And units should be routed to appropriate memory layers
    And metadata should reflect cognitive processing and quality

  @execution_prediction @learning_validation @medium_priority
  Scenario: Predict execution behavior using learned patterns
    Given I have a trained execution learning model
    And I have learned patterns from previous executions
    When I analyze new code for execution prediction
    Then execution outcomes should be predicted based on similar patterns
    And prediction confidence should be calculated
    And supporting patterns should be identified
    And alternative outcomes should be considered
    And predictions should improve with more training data

  @semantic_robustness @mutation_resistance @research_validated
  Scenario: Maintain understanding through semantic-preserving mutations
    Given I have code with clear execution patterns
    And the execution learning system is trained on the original code
    When I apply semantic-preserving mutations to the code
    Then the system should still understand the code's behavior
    And maintain >90% understanding accuracy
    And provide correct predictions for mutated code
    And identify that the mutations don't change fundamental behavior
    And demonstrate resistance to surface-level changes

  @integration_validation @memory_enhancement @medium_priority
  Scenario: Validate integration with enhanced memory and knowledge systems
    Given the execution learning integration is complete
    And Memetic Units are stored in appropriate memory layers
    And the enhanced knowledge graph contains execution insights
    When I query the integrated system for code understanding
    Then responses should include execution-based insights
    And semantic understanding should be enhanced by execution patterns
    And multi-hop queries should traverse execution knowledge
    And memory retrieval should prioritize learned patterns
    And overall system performance should meet benchmarks

  @performance_validation @scalability @low_priority
  Scenario: Validate performance characteristics of execution learning
    Given I have a large codebase with complex execution patterns
    And the execution learning system is processing multiple trajectories
    When I measure system performance during learning
    Then trajectory collection should complete in <2 seconds per code snippet
    And pattern extraction should scale with trajectory count
    And memory usage should remain <20% above baseline
    And learning accuracy should improve with more training data
    And system should handle concurrent learning sessions

  @research_benchmark @validation_framework @critical
  Scenario: Validate against research benchmarks for genuine understanding
    Given the execution learning system is fully integrated
    And comprehensive validation framework is available
    When I run research-backed validation tests
    Then semantic understanding should achieve >80% accuracy
    And mutation resistance should exceed 90% effectiveness
    And execution prediction should reach >80% accuracy
    And multi-hop reasoning should demonstrate >85% completeness
    And overall improvement should exceed 40% over baseline systems
