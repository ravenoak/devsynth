Feature: Enhanced Knowledge Graph with Business Intent Layer
  As a DevSynth developer
  I want the knowledge graph to include business intent and semantic linking
  So that AI agents can understand why code exists, not just what it does

  Background:
    Given the enhanced knowledge graph is configured with business intent layer
    And business requirements are loaded into the graph
    And code is analyzed and stored in the graph
    And intent linking is enabled and trained

  @intent_discovery @business_context @high_priority
  Scenario: Discover business intent from function names and comments
    Given I have a function named "calculate_user_monthly_revenue"
    And the function has comments about "monthly recurring revenue calculation"
    And there is a business requirement for "revenue tracking and reporting"
    When the intent discovery engine analyzes the function
    Then it should link the function to the revenue tracking requirement
    And assign a confidence score > 0.8
    And provide evidence of the semantic connection
    And validate the link against acceptance criteria

  @semantic_linking @meaning_barrier @critical
  Scenario: Bridge meaning barrier with semantic linking
    Given code comments contain business intent descriptions
    And requirements describe business needs and value
    When the semantic linking engine processes the artifacts
    Then it should create links between code and requirements with >80% accuracy
    And identify intent-implementation alignment issues
    And suggest improvements for unclear code intent
    And maintain semantic links during code evolution

  @multi_hop_reasoning @traceability @high_priority
  Scenario: Perform multi-hop reasoning across business and technical layers
    Given a business requirement is implemented by multiple functions
    And those functions are tested by several test cases
    And the tests validate specific acceptance criteria
    When I query "What requirements are implemented by functions tested by this test suite?"
    Then the system should traverse multiple hops correctly
    And identify the business requirement with >85% accuracy
    And provide complete traceability path
    And explain the reasoning steps taken
    And show confidence scores for each link in the chain

  @impact_analysis @blast_radius @medium_priority
  Scenario: Calculate business impact of technical changes
    Given a proposed change to a core authentication function
    And the function implements multiple business requirements
    And affects several user journeys
    When I query the impact of the proposed change
    Then the system should identify all affected business requirements
    And calculate the business value impact
    And assess risk to user experience
    And suggest mitigation strategies
    And provide confidence metrics for the analysis

  @intent_consistency @validation @medium_priority
  Scenario: Validate intent consistency across implementation
    Given I have code with misleading variable names
    And comments that contradict the implementation
    And commit messages with unclear intent
    When the intent discovery engine analyzes the inconsistencies
    Then it should identify the intent-implementation mismatch
    And assign low confidence scores to inconsistent links
    And suggest improvements for clearer intent expression
    And provide evidence for the inconsistency detection

  @performance @scalability @low_priority
  Scenario: Maintain performance with enhanced knowledge graph
    Given a large codebase with thousands of functions and requirements
    And the enhanced knowledge graph is fully populated
    And intent linking is active
    When I perform complex multi-hop queries
    Then query response time should be <2 seconds
    And memory usage should be <15% above baseline
    And all existing graph operations should continue to work
    And enhanced features should not degrade performance
