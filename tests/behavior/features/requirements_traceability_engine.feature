Feature: Requirements Traceability Engine
  As a developer
  I want automated requirements traceability
  So that I can ensure all requirements are properly implemented and tested

  Background:
    Given the DevSynth system is initialized
    And the requirements traceability engine is configured
    And I have a project with requirements, specifications, code, and tests

  @fast @traceability
  Scenario: Verify complete requirements traceability
    Given I have a requirements traceability matrix
    And I have specifications, code, and tests
    When I verify requirements traceability
    Then the system should validate all requirement references
    And the system should check specification links exist
    And the system should verify code implementation
    And the system should validate test coverage
    And the system should report any missing links

  @fast @traceability
  Scenario: Analyze traceability gaps
    Given I have a project with potential traceability gaps
    When I analyze traceability gaps
    Then the system should identify missing implementations
    And the system should identify missing tests
    And the system should identify missing documentation
    And the system should prioritize gaps by impact
    And the system should suggest remediation actions

  @fast @traceability
  Scenario: Generate traceability report
    Given I have traceability verification results
    When I generate a traceability report
    Then the report should include coverage analysis
    And the report should show gap analysis
    And the report should provide compliance status
    And the report should suggest improvements

  @fast @traceability
  Scenario: Monitor traceability continuously
    Given traceability monitoring is enabled
    When requirements or specifications change
    Then the system should detect traceability impacts
    And the system should generate traceability alerts
    And the system should suggest updates needed
    And the system should track traceability trends

  @fast @traceability
  Scenario: Validate cross-references
    Given I have specifications, code, and tests with references
    When I validate cross-references
    Then the system should verify all references are valid
    And the system should check bidirectional links
    And the system should identify broken references
    And the system should suggest reference fixes

  @fast @traceability
  Scenario: Verify specification completeness
    Given I have project specifications
    When I verify specification completeness
    Then the system should check for requirement references
    And the system should validate BDD feature links
    And the system should verify implementation references
    And the system should report completeness status

  @fast @traceability
  Scenario: Validate BDD feature consistency
    When I validate BDD feature consistency
    Then the system should check feature files reference requirements
    And the system should verify scenarios link to specifications
    And the system should validate step definition coverage
    And the system should report feature consistency issues

  @medium @traceability
  Scenario: Integrate with EDRR workflow
    Given the EDRR workflow is configured
    When I initiate a traceability verification task
    Then the system should use gap analysis in the Analysis phase
    And the system should use link validation in the Design phase
    And the system should use automated improvement in the Refinement phase
    And the memory system should store traceability results

  @fast @traceability
  Scenario: Generate traceability improvement suggestions
    Given I have traceability analysis results
    When I request traceability improvement suggestions
    Then the system should prioritize suggestions by impact
    And the system should provide implementation guidance
    And the system should estimate effort required
    And the system should predict traceability improvement outcomes

  @slow @traceability
  Scenario: Performance validation for large projects
    Given I have a large project with complex requirements
    When I run comprehensive traceability verification
    Then traceability verification should complete within performance targets
    And gap analysis should complete within targets
    And report generation should complete within targets
    And resource usage should remain within specified limits
