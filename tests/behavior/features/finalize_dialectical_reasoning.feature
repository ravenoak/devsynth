# Specification: docs/specifications/finalize-dialectical-reasoning.md
Feature: Finalize dialectical reasoning
  As a system maintainer
  I want dialectical reasoning to terminate
  So that recursive analyses remain bounded

  Scenario: Recursion depth limit halts reasoning
    Given a dialectical reasoning loop with max depth 3
    When the loop attempts a fourth recursion
    Then recursion stops to preserve termination

  Scenario: Python recursion guard triggers
    Given Python recursion limit is lower than required depth
    When the reasoning loop exceeds Python's recursion limit
    Then a recursion error is raised
