Feature: Cognitive-Temporal Memory (CTM) Framework Specification
    As a DevSynth developer
    I want to implement a Cognitive-Temporal Memory framework
    So that agents can have sophisticated memory capabilities for advanced reasoning

    Background:
        Given DevSynth is properly configured
        And CTM framework is enabled in configuration
        And memory backends are available

    @ctm-001 @memory_layers
    Scenario: Memory layers support four cognitive functions
        When I initialize the CTM framework
        Then it should provide four distinct memory layers:
            | Layer | Function | Description |
            | Working | Active manipulation of current context | Cognitive present for reasoning |
            | Episodic | Autobiographical record of experiences | Stream of experience over time |
            | Semantic | General knowledge and world model | Structured facts and relationships |
            | Procedural | Skills, plans, and executable knowledge | Library of capabilities |
        And each layer should have appropriate storage backend
        And layers should be functionally differentiated

    @ctm-002 @memetic_units
    Scenario: Memetic Units include required metadata fields
        When I create a Memetic Unit with sample data
        Then the unit should contain all required metadata fields:
            | Field | Type | Purpose |
            | unit_id | UUID | Unique identifier |
            | parent_id | Optional[UUID] | Causal predecessor |
            | source | MemeticSource | Origin of memory |
            | timestamp_created | datetime | Creation time |
            | timestamp_accessed | Optional[datetime] | Last access time |
            | cognitive_type | CognitiveType | Memory layer classification |
            | content_hash | str | Content integrity check |
            | semantic_vector | List[float] | Embedding for similarity search |
            | keywords | List[str] | Extracted keywords |
            | topic | str | Classified topic |
            | status | MemeticStatus | Lifecycle state |
            | confidence_score | float | Confidence in accuracy |
            | salience_score | float | Importance/relevance score |
            | access_control | Dict | Permissions for multi-agent access |
            | lifespan_policy | Dict | Expiration and decay rules |
            | links | List[MemeticLink] | Relationships to other units |
        And the payload should support any data type

    @ctm-003 @context_assembly
    Scenario: Context assembly improves LLM response quality
        Given I have a complex multi-step reasoning task
        When I use CTM context assembly instead of simple RAG
        Then the assembled context should be more relevant and comprehensive
        And LLM response quality should improve by at least 20%
        And context should include appropriate information from multiple memory layers
        And context assembly should complete within timeout limits

    @ctm-004 @memory_governance
    Scenario: Memory governance maintains system performance
        Given the system has accumulated many memory units over time
        When memory governance processes run periodically
        Then low-salience units should be archived or removed
        And system performance should remain stable
        And memory retrieval should remain efficient
        And storage usage should not grow unbounded

    @ctm-005 @backward_compatibility
    Scenario: CTM integration maintains existing functionality
        Given existing DevSynth functionality is working
        When I enable CTM framework
        Then existing MemoryManager interface should continue to work
        And existing memory operations should function normally
        And no existing tests should fail
        And performance should not degrade significantly

    @ctm_ingestion @memory_operations
    Scenario: Memetic Unit ingestion and annotation
        Given I have raw data from various sources
        When I ingest the data through the CTM pipeline
        Then each data item should be converted to a Memetic Unit
        And appropriate metadata should be automatically generated
        And cognitive type should be correctly classified
        And semantic descriptors should be computed
        And units should be stored in appropriate memory layers

    @ctm_consolidation @learning
    Scenario: Episodic to semantic consolidation
        Given I have accumulated episodic memories of similar patterns
        When consolidation process runs
        Then it should identify recurring patterns
        And create semantic units representing generalized knowledge
        And link episodic memories to semantic abstractions
        And improve future retrieval relevance

    @ctm_context_assembly @task_awareness
    Scenario: Task-aware context assembly
        Given I have different types of tasks requiring different memory access
        When context assembly processes each task type
        Then it should query appropriate memory layers:
            | Task Type | Primary Layer | Secondary Layers |
            | Code Generation | Procedural | Semantic |
            | Requirement Analysis | Semantic | Episodic |
            | Error Debugging | Episodic | Procedural |
            | Design Planning | Semantic | Procedural |
        And assembled context should be optimized for the specific task
        And context size should respect token limits

    @ctm_multi_agent @stigmergy
    Scenario: Multi-agent memory coordination via stigmergy
        Given multiple agents are working on a shared project
        When agents need to coordinate without direct communication
        Then they should use shared memory as stigmergic environment
        And agents should publish task requests to shared memory
        And other agents should discover and claim tasks via memory queries
        And coordination should be indirect and scalable

    @ctm_forgetting @relevance
    Scenario: Intelligent forgetting maintains relevance
        Given memory system has accumulated diverse information over time
        When forgetting policies are applied
        Then frequently accessed high-value memories should be retained
        And outdated or low-relevance memories should be archived
        And system should maintain optimal performance
        And critical project knowledge should be preserved

    @ctm_persistence @recovery
    Scenario: Memory persistence and recovery
        Given CTM system has been running and accumulating memories
        When system restarts or recovers from failure
        Then all memory layers should restore their state
        And no memory units should be lost
        And memory relationships should be preserved
        And system should resume normal operation

    @ctm_performance @scaling
    Scenario: CTM scales with project complexity
        Given projects of varying sizes and complexities
        When CTM processes memory operations
        Then performance should scale appropriately:
            | Project Size | Memory Operations | Performance Requirement |
            | Small (1-10 files) | Basic CRUD | Sub-second response |
            | Medium (10-100 files) | Complex queries | < 5 second response |
            | Large (100+ files) | Multi-hop reasoning | < 30 second response |
        And memory usage should be proportional to project size
        And retrieval quality should not degrade with scale

    @ctm_edrr_integration @reasoning_enhancement
    Scenario: CTM enhances EDRR reasoning phases
        Given I am using EDRR reasoning framework
        When each EDRR phase executes
        Then it should leverage appropriate CTM memory layers:
            | EDRR Phase | Memory Enhancement | Expected Benefit |
            | Expand | Vector similarity for diverse examples | Broader solution exploration |
            | Differentiate | Graph traversal for relationship analysis | Better comparison and analysis |
            | Refine | Historical pattern matching | Improved refinement based on experience |
            | Retrospect | Learning from outcomes | Continuous improvement |
        And overall reasoning quality should improve

    @ctm_wsde_integration @agent_collaboration
    Scenario: CTM supports WSDE agent roles
        Given WSDE multi-agent system is active
        When different agent roles need memory access
        Then each role should have appropriate memory layer access:
            | WSDE Role | Memory Access Pattern | Use Case |
            | Primus | All layers for coordination | Project-wide context and synthesis |
            | Worker | Focused context + procedural | Task execution with relevant tools |
            | Supervisor | Quality metrics + standards | Validation and critique capabilities |
            | Designer | Architectural patterns | Design reasoning and planning |
            | Evaluator | Requirements + criteria | Assessment and feedback |
        And memory access should support role-based permissions

    @ctm_monitoring @observability
    Scenario: CTM provides comprehensive monitoring
        Given CTM framework is operational
        When I request memory system metrics
        Then I should receive comprehensive statistics:
            | Metric Category | Metrics | Purpose |
            | Storage | Units per layer, storage size | Capacity planning |
            | Performance | Query latency, throughput | Performance optimization |
            | Quality | Retrieval relevance, consolidation success | Quality assurance |
            | Lifecycle | Created, accessed, forgotten units | Trend analysis |
        And metrics should be available via CLI and WebUI
        And metrics should support debugging and optimization
