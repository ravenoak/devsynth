Feature: Dynamic Tool Management Specification
  As a DevSynth developer
  I want intelligent tool selection and management
  So that agents can scale effectively without cognitive overload from excessive tools

  Background:
    Given the dynamic tool management system is configured
    And ToolRAG is enabled for tool retrieval
    And hierarchical tool organization is active
    And provider context window integration is operational
    And cognitive load mitigation is working

  @attention_budget_optimization @finite_resources @high_priority
  Scenario: Optimize attention budget with dynamic tool scoping
    Given agents have finite attention budgets for context
    When dynamic tool scoping manages finite resources
    Then tool utility should be prioritized over tool quantity
    And signal-to-noise ratio should be maximized for tools
    And contextually relevant tools should be provided based on intent
    And diminishing returns should be prevented
    And resource allocation should be optimized

  @toolrag_integration @retrieval_augmented @high_priority
  Scenario: Implement ToolRAG for dynamic tool retrieval
    Given tool definitions are indexed in vector/graph stores
    When ToolRAG performs query-aware retrieval
    Then tool corpus should be searchable by capabilities
    And user queries should be analyzed for tool requirements
    And hybrid search should combine semantic similarity and keywords
    And re-ranking pipeline should optimize tool relevance
    And only relevant tools should be exposed to LLMs

  @contextual_function_calling @two_phase @medium_priority
  Scenario: Enable contextual function-calling framework
    Given complex queries require multiple tool capabilities
    When two-phase function-calling is utilized
    Then capability identification phase should analyze query needs
    And implementation selection phase should map to concrete tools
    And abstract capabilities should be identified first
    And concrete tool implementations should be selected second
    And tool selection should be optimized for context

  @hierarchical_organization @taxonomy @medium_priority
  Scenario: Organize tools in hierarchical taxonomy
    Given tools need to be organized for efficient retrieval
    When hierarchical tool organization is applied
    Then tools should be categorized by domain areas
    And tools should be classified by functional capabilities
    And tool dependencies should be mapped using graph structures
    And coarse-to-fine selection should work from categories to specifics
    And progressive disclosure should reveal details as needed

  @architectural_decoupling @tool_selector @medium_priority
  Scenario: Decouple tool selection from reasoning
    Given tool management needs to scale independently
    When architectural decoupling is implemented
    Then tool selector service should handle discovery and filtering
    And reasoning LLM should focus on task execution
    And proxy layer should intercept and filter tool requests
    And tool selection should be separated from reasoning
    And scalability should be improved

  @api_gateway_pattern @routing @low_priority
  Scenario: Implement API gateway for tool management
    Given tools need to be routed and managed centrally
    When API gateway pattern is applied
    Then request routing should direct to appropriate implementations
    And load balancing should distribute tool usage
    And caching layer should optimize frequent selections
    And tool management should be centralized
    And performance should be improved

  @memory_system_integration @storage_extension @low_priority
  Scenario: Integrate with DevSynth memory systems
    Given tools need to be indexed and retrieved efficiently
    When memory system integration occurs
    Then vector store should index tool definitions
    And graph store should model tool relationships
    And structured store should track usage patterns
    And tool retrieval should be optimized
    And tool metadata should be comprehensive

  @wsde_integration @agent_roles @low_priority
  Scenario: Integrate with WSDE agent model
    Given different agent roles need appropriate tool sets
    When WSDE integration is active
    Then different roles should get contextually appropriate tools
    And EDRR phases should use dynamic tool scoping
    And context engineering should integrate tool management
    And agent effectiveness should improve
    And cognitive load should be reduced per role

  @provider_context_window @adaptive_selection @medium_priority
  Scenario: Adapt tool selection to provider context windows
    Given different providers have varying context limits
    When provider-aware tool scoping is active
    Then context budgets should be adjusted per provider
    And tool subsets should vary by context capacity
    And context window discovery should work automatically
    And fallback optimization should reduce exposure when needed
    And cross-provider routing should optimize for capacity

  @performance_optimization @efficiency @low_priority
  Scenario: Optimize performance with caching and batching
    Given tool retrieval needs to be efficient at scale
    When performance optimization is applied
    Then caching strategies should reduce redundant retrievals
    And batch processing should optimize multi-turn conversations
    And incremental updates should support real-time registration
    And retrieval efficiency should improve
    And response times should be reduced

  @quality_metrics @accuracy_tracking @low_priority
  Scenario: Track quality metrics for tool management
    Given tool management needs quality assurance
    When quality metrics are tracked
    Then tool selection accuracy should be measured
    And performance impact should be monitored
    And cognitive load reduction should be quantified
    And context window utilization should be tracked
    And provider-aware optimization should be measured

  @error_handling @resilience @low_priority
  Scenario: Handle errors and provide resilience
    Given tool operations can fail or timeout
    When error handling mechanisms are active
    Then tool call retry logic should use exponential backoff
    And fallback mechanisms should provide alternative tools
    And self-correction loops should enable parameter correction
    And usage analytics should track success rates
    And continuous learning should improve selection algorithms
