Feature: Test Generation
  As a developer
  I want DevSynth to generate tests based on requirements
  So that I can follow test-driven development practices

  Scenario: Generate unit tests from requirements
    Given I have a DevSynth project with analyzed requirements
    When I run the command "devsynth generate tests --type unit"
    Then the system should generate unit test files
    And the tests should cover the core functionality described in requirements
    And the tests should follow best practices for unit testing

  Scenario: Generate behavior tests from requirements
    Given I have a DevSynth project with analyzed requirements
    When I run the command "devsynth generate tests --type behavior"
    Then the system should generate Gherkin feature files
    And the features should describe the expected behavior of the system
    And the system should generate step definition skeletons
