@graphrag @knowledge_graph @retrieval_augmented_generation
Feature: GraphRAG Integration
    As a DevSynth developer
    I want to implement GraphRAG capabilities
    So that agents can perform sophisticated multi-hop reasoning over structured knowledge

    Background:
        Given DevSynth is properly configured
        And knowledge graph backend is available
        And GraphRAG integration is enabled

    @grag-001 @multi_hop_queries
    Scenario: GraphRAG supports multi-hop queries across entity relationships
        Given I have a complex software project with interconnected components
        When I ask a multi-hop question like "What requirements are tested by tests that use function X?"
        Then GraphRAG should traverse multiple relationship types:
            | Traversal Step | Relationship Type | Expected Result |
            | 1 | Function X → Tests | Find tests that use function X |
            | 2 | Tests → Requirements | Find requirements tested by those tests |
        And return a comprehensive answer with traceability chain
        And the response should be grounded in actual graph relationships

    @grag-002 @response_grounding
    Scenario: Response grounding is verifiable against knowledge graph
        Given I ask a question about code relationships
        When GraphRAG generates a response
        Then every fact in the response should be verifiable against the knowledge graph
        And the system should provide confidence scores for each assertion
        And I should be able to trace response claims back to graph entities
        And hallucinated information should be detectable and flagged

    @grag-003 @natural_language_processing
    Scenario: Query processing handles natural language input
        Given I ask questions in natural language
        When I use various question types:
            | Question Type | Example | Expected Processing |
            | Entity Info | "What does function calculate_total do?" | Extract "function" and "calculate_total" |
            | Relationship | "What calls the authenticate function?" | Extract relationship "calls" and entity "authenticate" |
            | Impact | "What would break if I change class User?" | Extract change impact pattern |
            | Pattern | "Find similar functions to validate_input" | Extract pattern matching intent |
        Then GraphRAG should correctly parse intent and entities
        And map natural language to appropriate graph traversal patterns

    @grag-004 @context_linearization
    Scenario: Context linearization produces LLM-friendly output
        Given GraphRAG extracts a relevant subgraph
        When it linearizes the context for LLM consumption
        Then it should use appropriate linearization strategies:
            | Strategy | Use Case | Output Format |
            | Hierarchical | General queries | Entity → Properties → Relationships |
            | Task-oriented | Code generation | Interface → Dependencies → Examples |
            | Citation | Fact verification | Source → Evidence → Confidence |
        And the linearized context should be optimally formatted for LLM reasoning
        And context should respect token limits while preserving essential information

    @grag-005 @integration_enhancement
    Scenario: GraphRAG enhances existing DevSynth capabilities
        Given existing DevSynth functionality is working
        When I enable GraphRAG integration
        Then it should enhance rather than replace existing features:
            | Feature | Enhancement | Backward Compatibility |
            | Memory System | Graph traversal queries | Existing vector/semantic search preserved |
            | Agent Reasoning | Multi-hop reasoning capabilities | Existing single-hop reasoning maintained |
            | EDRR Framework | Richer context for each phase | Existing EDRR phases continue to work |
            | WSDE Agents | Structured knowledge access | Existing agent roles preserved |
        And overall system performance should not degrade significantly

    @graph_construction @knowledge_extraction
    Scenario: Knowledge graph construction from software artifacts
        Given I have a software project with code, tests, and documentation
        When GraphRAG processes the project
        Then it should extract and link multiple entity types:
            | Artifact Type | Entities Extracted | Relationships Established |
            | Source Code | Functions, Classes, Variables | Calls, Inherits, Contains, Uses |
            | Requirements | User Stories, Features | Implements, Related To |
            | Tests | Test Cases, Assertions | Tests, Depends On, Validates |
            | Documentation | Sections, References | Documents, References |
        And create a comprehensive knowledge graph
        And establish traceability links between artifact types

    @query_parsing @intent_analysis
    Scenario: Query intent analysis and entity resolution
        Given I submit various types of natural language queries
        When GraphRAG analyzes the queries
        Then it should correctly identify:
            | Query Element | Analysis | Resolution |
            | Intent | What the user wants to know | Query type classification |
            | Entities | Specific objects mentioned | Graph node mapping |
            | Relationships | Connections between entities | Relationship type identification |
            | Context | Implicit requirements | Additional traversal needed |
        And handle ambiguous or partial entity names
        And suggest corrections for unrecognized entities

    @traversal_planning @query_optimization
    Scenario: Graph traversal planning and optimization
        Given I have a complex query requiring multiple hops
        When GraphRAG plans the traversal
        Then it should create an optimal execution plan:
            | Planning Aspect | Optimization | Result |
            | Path Selection | Shortest vs. most informative paths | Efficient traversal |
            | Depth Limiting | Prevent infinite loops | Bounded exploration |
            | Entity Filtering | Focus on relevant entities | Reduced noise |
            | Relationship Prioritization | Important relationships first | Better context |
        And the plan should be executable and efficient

    @context_assembly @llm_integration
    Scenario: Context assembly for LLM reasoning
        Given GraphRAG has extracted relevant subgraph information
        When it assembles context for LLM
        Then it should create context that enables better reasoning:
            | Context Component | Purpose | Enhancement |
            | Entity Descriptions | What entities are and do | Rich entity understanding |
            | Relationship Explanations | How entities connect | Relationship awareness |
            | Property Details | Specific attributes and values | Detailed context |
            | Traceability Chains | How information connects | Multi-hop reasoning support |
        And context should be structured for optimal LLM consumption
        And include appropriate grounding instructions

    @quality_assurance @fact_verification
    Scenario: Response quality assurance and fact verification
        Given GraphRAG generates a response to a query
        When I validate the response quality
        Then it should verify all claims against the knowledge graph
        And detect and flag any hallucinations
        And provide confidence scores for each assertion
        And suggest corrections for inaccurate information
        And maintain audit trail for fact verification

    @performance_optimization @scalability
    Scenario: GraphRAG performance optimization for large projects
        Given projects of varying sizes and complexities
        When GraphRAG processes queries
        Then performance should scale appropriately:
            | Project Size | Query Complexity | Performance Requirement |
            | Small (1-10 files) | Simple entity queries | < 1 second response |
            | Medium (10-100 files) | Relationship queries | < 5 second response |
            | Large (100+ files) | Multi-hop queries | < 30 second response |
        And memory usage should be proportional to project size
        And query accuracy should not degrade with scale

    @edrr_enhancement @reasoning_improvement
    Scenario: GraphRAG enhances EDRR reasoning phases
        Given I am using EDRR reasoning with GraphRAG enabled
        When each EDRR phase executes
        Then GraphRAG should provide enhanced context:
            | EDRR Phase | GraphRAG Contribution | Reasoning Improvement |
            | Expand | Traverse related entities for broader exploration | More comprehensive solution space |
            | Differentiate | Compare entity relationships and properties | Better analysis of alternatives |
            | Refine | Follow implementation chains and dependencies | More informed refinement decisions |
            | Retrospect | Analyze historical patterns and outcomes | Better learning from experience |
        And overall EDRR reasoning quality should improve measurably

    @agent_integration @multi_hop_reasoning
    Scenario: Agents use GraphRAG for multi-hop reasoning
        Given WSDE agents have GraphRAG capabilities
        When agents need to reason about complex relationships
        Then they should use GraphRAG for sophisticated queries:
            | Agent Role | GraphRAG Usage | Benefit |
            | Primus | Project-wide relationship analysis | Better coordination decisions |
            | Worker | Dependency and impact analysis | More accurate task execution |
            | Supervisor | Quality and compliance checking | Better validation capabilities |
            | Designer | Architectural pattern discovery | Improved design reasoning |
            | Evaluator | Requirement fulfillment verification | More thorough assessment |
        And agents should be able to ask complex multi-hop questions
        And receive structured, verifiable responses

    @monitoring @observability
    Scenario: GraphRAG provides comprehensive monitoring and metrics
        Given GraphRAG system is operational
        When I request system metrics
        Then I should receive detailed statistics:
            | Metric Category | Specific Metrics | Purpose |
            | Query Performance | Response time, traversal depth, entities processed | Performance optimization |
            | Knowledge Quality | Entity coverage, relationship density, traceability completeness | Quality assurance |
            | Usage Patterns | Most queried entities, common traversal patterns | Usage insights |
            | System Health | Graph size, query success rate, error frequency | Operational monitoring |
        And metrics should be available via CLI and WebUI
        And support debugging and optimization efforts
