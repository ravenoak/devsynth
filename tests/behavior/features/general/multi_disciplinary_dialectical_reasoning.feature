Feature: Multi-disciplinary Dialectical Reasoning
  As a developer
  I want to use multi-disciplinary dialectical reasoning in WSDE teams
  So that solutions can benefit from diverse expertise across multiple domains

  Background:
    Given a WSDE team with agents specialized in different disciplines
    And a knowledge base with multi-disciplinary information
    And the team is configured for multi-disciplinary dialectical reasoning

  Scenario: Gathering disciplinary perspectives
    Given a complex problem spanning multiple disciplines
    When the team initiates multi-disciplinary dialectical reasoning
    Then each disciplinary agent should provide a specialized perspective
    And each perspective should focus on domain-specific considerations
    And the perspectives should be documented with disciplinary context
    And the collection of perspectives should cover all relevant disciplines

  Scenario: Identifying perspective conflicts across disciplines
    Given perspectives from multiple disciplinary agents
    When the team analyzes the perspectives
    Then conflicts between disciplinary perspectives should be identified
    And each conflict should be categorized by type and severity
    And the underlying disciplinary assumptions should be documented
    And the conflicts should be prioritized for resolution

  Scenario: Multi-disciplinary synthesis generation
    Given perspectives and identified conflicts from multiple disciplines
    When the team generates a multi-disciplinary synthesis
    Then the synthesis should address all identified conflicts
    And the synthesis should integrate insights from all disciplines
    And the synthesis should maintain disciplinary integrity where appropriate
    And the synthesis should document trade-offs between disciplinary requirements

  Scenario: Multi-disciplinary evaluation
    Given a synthesis generated from multi-disciplinary perspectives
    When the team evaluates the synthesis
    Then the evaluation should assess the solution from each disciplinary perspective
    And the evaluation should verify compliance with discipline-specific standards
    And the evaluation should identify any remaining disciplinary concerns
    And the evaluation should provide an overall assessment of multi-disciplinary quality

  Scenario: Integration with domain-specific knowledge
    Given a multi-disciplinary reasoning process
    And domain-specific knowledge sources for each discipline
    When the team applies multi-disciplinary dialectical reasoning
    Then each disciplinary perspective should incorporate domain-specific knowledge
    And the knowledge should be properly attributed to authoritative sources
    And the synthesis should reflect current best practices across all disciplines
    And the solution should demonstrate awareness of cross-disciplinary implications
