Feature: Project State Analysis
  As a developer using DevSynth
  I want to analyze the state of my project
  So that I can assess its structure and alignment

  Scenario: pending project state analysis
    Given a project repository
    When I run a project state analysis
    Then I should receive a summary of the project structure
