Feature: Complete Memory System Integration
  As a developer using DevSynth
  I want integrated multi-layered memory with tiered caching
  So that I can efficiently store and retrieve context, history, and knowledge

  Background:
    Given the DevSynth memory system is initialized
    And multiple memory backends are configured

  @fast @reqid-complete-memory-system-integration
  Scenario: Multi-layered memory stores different information types
    Given information with content "user query context" and type "CONTEXT"
    When I store it in the memory system
    Then it is categorized in the short-term memory layer
    And I can retrieve it from the short-term layer

  @fast @reqid-complete-memory-system-integration
  Scenario: Episodic memory preserves task execution history
    Given a completed task with execution details
    When I store the task history in memory
    Then it is categorized in the episodic memory layer
    And historical task data remains accessible for analysis

  @fast @reqid-complete-memory-system-integration
  Scenario: Semantic memory stores domain knowledge
    Given domain knowledge about "Python best practices"
    When I store it with type "KNOWLEDGE"
    Then it is categorized in the semantic memory layer
    And knowledge remains available for future reference

  @fast @reqid-complete-memory-system-integration
  Scenario: Tiered caching improves access performance
    Given a memory system with tiered caching enabled
    When I access frequently used information
    Then it is served from the in-memory cache
    And access time is faster than backend retrieval

  @fast @reqid-complete-memory-system-integration
  Scenario: Memory backend integration supports multiple storage types
    Given memory backends including in-memory, file-based, and database
    When I configure different backend types
    Then data migrates seamlessly between backends
    And backend failover maintains data availability

  @fast @reqid-complete-memory-system-integration
  Scenario: Memory operations maintain performance bounds
    Given memory operations with large datasets
    When operations complete within time limits
    Then retrieval operations complete within 100ms
    And storage operations complete within acceptable bounds
    And memory usage remains within configured limits
