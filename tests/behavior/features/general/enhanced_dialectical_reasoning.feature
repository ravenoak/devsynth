Feature: Enhanced Dialectical Reasoning
  As a developer
  I want to use enhanced dialectical reasoning in WSDE teams
  So that solutions can be improved through structured thesis-antithesis-synthesis processes

  Background:
    Given a WSDE team with multiple agents
    And at least one agent designated as a critic
    And the team is configured for enhanced dialectical reasoning

  Scenario: Complete thesis-antithesis-synthesis workflow
    Given a solution proposed by an agent as a thesis
    When the dialectical reasoning process is initiated
    Then a critic agent should generate a comprehensive antithesis
    And the antithesis should challenge key assumptions of the thesis
    And a synthesis should be generated combining strengths of both
    And the synthesis should resolve contradictions between thesis and antithesis
    And the final solution should be demonstrably better than the original thesis

  Scenario: Multi-perspective analysis in dialectical reasoning
    Given a complex problem with multiple valid approaches
    When the team applies enhanced dialectical reasoning
    Then multiple perspectives should be considered
    And each perspective should be analyzed for strengths and weaknesses
    And the analysis should consider different domains of expertise
    And the synthesis should incorporate insights from all perspectives
    And the final solution should be more robust than any single perspective

  Scenario: Knowledge integration from dialectical process
    Given a dialectical reasoning process has completed
    When the team integrates the knowledge gained
    Then key insights should be extracted and documented
    And the knowledge should be stored in the team's memory system
    And the knowledge should be categorized by domain and relevance
    And the integrated knowledge should be available for future tasks
    And the knowledge integration should improve team performance over time

  Scenario: Enhanced antithesis generation with knowledge graph
    Given a solution proposed as a thesis
    And a knowledge graph with relevant domain knowledge
    When a critic agent generates an antithesis
    Then the antithesis should leverage insights from the knowledge graph
    And the antithesis should reference established best practices
    And the antithesis should identify potential issues based on historical patterns
    And the quality of the antithesis should be higher than without knowledge graph

  Scenario: Enhanced synthesis with standards compliance
    Given a thesis and antithesis for a technical solution
    And a set of technical standards and best practices
    When the synthesis is generated
    Then the synthesis should comply with all applicable standards
    And the synthesis should incorporate best practices from both thesis and antithesis
    And the synthesis should explicitly address compliance requirements
    And the synthesis should include justification for any standards exceptions
