  As a developer
  I want an improved WebUI experience
  So that I can work more efficiently with DevSynth

  Scenario: WebUI shows enhanced progress indicators

    Then I should see an enhanced progress indicator
    And the progress indicator should show estimated time remaining
    And the progress indicator should show subtasks

  Scenario: WebUI displays colorized output
    Given the WebUI is initialized
    When I run a command that produces different types of output
    Then success messages should be displayed in green
    And warning messages should be displayed in yellow
    And error messages should be displayed in red
    And informational messages should be displayed in blue

  Scenario: WebUI provides detailed error messages
    Given the WebUI is initialized
    When I run a command that produces an error
    Then I should see a detailed error message
    And the error message should include suggestions
    And the error message should include documentation links

  Scenario: WebUI shows help text with examples
    Given the WebUI is initialized
    When I view help for a command
    Then I should see detailed help text
    And the help text should include usage examples
    And the help text should explain all available options

  Scenario: WebUI integrates with UXBridge
    Given the WebUI is initialized
    When I interact with the WebUI
    Then the interactions should use the UXBridge abstraction
    And the WebUI should behave consistently with the CLI

  Scenario: WebUI provides a responsive user interface
    Given the WebUI is initialized
    When I resize the browser window
    Then the WebUI should adapt to the new size
    And all elements should remain accessible and usable

  Scenario: WebUI supports all CLI commands
    Given the WebUI is initialized
    When I navigate to different pages
    Then I should be able to access all CLI commands

    And the command interfaces should be consistent

  Scenario: WebUI surfaces actionable guidance for missing files
    Given a WebUI instance with sanitized stubs
    When the WebUI reports "File not found: config.yaml"
    Then the WebUI should surface suggestions and documentation links
    And the WebUI should log the error banner
