# Specification: docs/specifications/finalize-dialectical-reasoning.md
Feature: Finalize dialectical reasoning
  As a system maintainer
  I want dialectical reasoning to terminate
  So that recursive analyses remain bounded

  @fast
  Scenario: Recursion depth limit halts reasoning
    Given a dialectical reasoning loop with max depth 3
    When the loop attempts a fourth recursion
    Then recursion stops to preserve termination

  @medium
  Scenario: Python recursion guard triggers
    Given Python recursion limit is lower than required depth
    When the reasoning loop exceeds Python's recursion limit
    Then a recursion error is raised

  @fast
  Scenario: Remaining budget guard cancels pending retry
    Given the reasoning loop has a strict total time budget
    When a transient error occurs after the budget is exhausted
    Then recursion halts before performing an additional retry

  @medium
  Scenario: Failure telemetry captures retry exhaustion
    Given the reasoning loop emits telemetry for retry attempts
    When all retry attempts fail to recover
    Then the telemetry records the retry exhaustion for diagnostics

  @fast
  Scenario: Non-mapping task payload is rejected
    Given a reasoning loop receives a non-mapping task payload
    When execution begins with the malformed payload
    Then a type error is raised to protect invariant enforcement
