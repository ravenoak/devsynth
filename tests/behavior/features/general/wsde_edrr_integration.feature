Feature: WSDE-EDRR Integration
  As a developer using DevSynth
  I want the WSDE agent model to integrate seamlessly with the EDRR framework
  So that I can benefit from context-driven, multi-agent collaboration throughout the development cycle

  Background:
    Given the DevSynth system is initialized
    And the WSDE team is configured with agents having different expertise
    And the EDRR coordinator is initialized with enhanced features

  Scenario: Phase-specific expertise utilization
    When I start an EDRR cycle with a task to "implement a sorting algorithm"
    Then the WSDE team should assign the Primus role to an agent with expertise in "exploration"
    When the EDRR cycle progresses to the "Differentiate" phase
    Then the WSDE team should assign the Primus role to an agent with expertise in "analysis"
    When the EDRR cycle progresses to the "Refine" phase
    Then the WSDE team should assign the Primus role to an agent with expertise in "implementation"
    When the EDRR cycle progresses to the "Retrospect" phase
    Then the WSDE team should assign the Primus role to an agent with expertise in "evaluation"

  Scenario: Quality-based phase transitions
    When I start an EDRR cycle with a task to "create a user authentication system"
    And the WSDE team produces high-quality results for the current phase
    Then the EDRR coordinator should automatically progress to the next phase
    When the WSDE team produces low-quality results for the current phase
    Then the EDRR coordinator should not progress to the next phase
    And the EDRR coordinator should request improvements from the WSDE team

  Scenario: Micro-cycle implementation
    When I start an EDRR cycle with a task to "implement a caching mechanism"
    And the EDRR coordinator initiates a micro-cycle
    Then the WSDE team should collaborate on the micro-cycle task
    And the micro-cycle results should be aggregated into the main cycle
    And the EDRR coordinator should determine if additional micro-cycles are needed

  Scenario: Dialectical reasoning across EDRR phases
    When I start an EDRR cycle with a task to "design a database schema"
    Then the WSDE team should apply dialectical reasoning in the "Expand" phase
    And the synthesis from the "Expand" phase should inform the "Differentiate" phase
    When the EDRR cycle progresses to the "Refine" phase
    Then the WSDE team should apply dialectical reasoning to the implementation
    And the final solution should reflect the dialectical process throughout all phases

  Scenario: Error handling and recovery
    When I start an EDRR cycle with a task to "parse complex JSON data"
    And an error occurs during the WSDE team's processing
    Then the EDRR coordinator should handle the error gracefully
    And the EDRR coordinator should attempt recovery strategies
    And the WSDE team should be able to continue the cycle after recovery
