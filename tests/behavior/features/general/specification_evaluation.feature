Feature: Specification Evaluation
  As a reviewer
  I want to evaluate specifications for completeness
  So that gaps are identified before implementation

  Scenario: Placeholder scenario
    Given a draft specification
    When it is evaluated against project goals
    Then feedback highlights missing details
