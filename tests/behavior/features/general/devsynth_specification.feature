Feature: DevSynth Technical Specification
  As a maintainer
  I want the DevSynth specification to guide development
  So that all components align with documented requirements

  Scenario: Placeholder scenario
    Given the specification is published
    When contributors review the guidelines
    Then the project reflects the specification
