Feature: Code Analysis
  As a developer
  I want to analyze my codebase structure and quality
  So that I can understand the project architecture and identify improvement opportunities

  Scenario: Analyze project structure and metrics
    Given the inspect-code command is available
    When I run the inspect-code command
    Then I should see project structure analysis
    And I should see code quality metrics
    And I should see language detection results
    And I should see size and complexity metrics
