Feature: Delimiting recursion algorithms
  As a developer
  I want to ensure the Delimiting recursion algorithms specification has BDD coverage
  So that the system behavior aligns with requirements

  @fast @reqid-delimiting-recursion-algorithms
  Scenario: Validate Delimiting recursion algorithms
    Given the specification "delimiting_recursion_algorithms.md" exists
    Then the BDD coverage acknowledges the specification
