Feature: Multi-Agent Collaboration
  As a developer
  I want agents to collaborate as peers under the WSDE model
  So that decisions reflect expertise-driven consensus

  Background:
    Given the DevSynth system is initialized
    And a team of agents is configured
    And the WSDE model is enabled

  Scenario: Peer-based collaboration
    When I create a team with multiple agents
    Then all agents should be treated as peers
    And no agent should have permanent hierarchical authority
    And agents should be able to collaborate without rigid role sequences

  Scenario: Consensus-based decision making
    Given a team with multiple agents
    When multiple solutions are proposed for a task
    Then the system should facilitate consensus building
    And the final decision should reflect input from all relevant agents
    And no single agent should have dictatorial authority
