Feature: Consensus Building
  As a developer
  I want to use consensus building mechanisms in WSDE teams
  So that agents can reach agreement on complex decisions through collaborative processes

  Background:
    Given a WSDE team with multiple agents
    And each agent has different expertise areas
    And the team is configured for consensus building

  Scenario: Voting mechanisms for critical decisions
    Given a critical decision with multiple options
    When the team needs to select the best option
    Then all agents should participate in the voting process
    And each agent's vote should be weighted based on relevant expertise
    And the voting results should be recorded with explanations
    And the selected option should have the highest weighted score

  Scenario: Conflict resolution in decision making
    Given a decision with conflicting agent opinions
    When the team attempts to reach consensus
    Then the conflicts should be identified and documented
    And the team should engage in a structured conflict resolution process
    And agents should provide reasoning for their positions
    And a resolution should be reached that addresses key concerns
    And the resolution process should be documented for future reference

  Scenario: Weighted voting based on expertise
    Given a technical decision requiring specialized knowledge
    When the team votes on the decision
    Then agents with relevant expertise should have higher voting weight
    And the expertise assessment should be transparent and justifiable
    And the weighted voting should lead to a technically sound decision
    And the decision should include rationale referencing expert opinions

  Scenario: Tie-breaking strategies
    Given a decision where voting results in a tie
    When the team needs to resolve the tie
    Then the team should apply predefined tie-breaking strategies
    And the strategies should consider expertise in relevant domains
    And the tie resolution should be fair and transparent
    And the final decision should be documented with the tie-breaking rationale

  Scenario: Decision tracking and explanation
    Given a series of decisions made by the team
    When the decisions are implemented
    Then each decision should be tracked with metadata
    And the tracking should include voting results and rationale
    And the explanation should reference relevant expertise and considerations
    And the decision history should be queryable for future reference
    And the explanations should be clear enough for external stakeholders to understand
