Feature: Code Transformation
  As a developer using DevSynth
  I want to transform code using various techniques
  So that I can improve code quality, readability, and maintainability

  Background:
    Given the DevSynth system is initialized
    And the code transformer is configured

  Scenario: Transform code with unused imports
    Given I have Python code with unused imports
    When I transform the code using the "remove_unused_imports" transformation
    Then the transformed code should not contain unused imports
    And the transformed code should maintain the original functionality
    And the transformation should record the changes made

  Scenario: Transform code with redundant assignments
    Given I have Python code with redundant assignments
    When I transform the code using the "remove_redundant_assignments" transformation
    Then the transformed code should not contain redundant assignments
    And the transformed code should maintain the original functionality
    And the transformation should record the changes made

  Scenario: Transform code with unused variables
    Given I have Python code with unused variables
    When I transform the code using the "remove_unused_variables" transformation
    Then the transformed code should not contain unused variables
    And the transformed code should maintain the original functionality
    And the transformation should record the changes made

  Scenario: Transform code with string literals
    Given I have Python code with string literals that can be optimized
    When I transform the code using the "optimize_string_literals" transformation
    Then the transformed code should contain optimized string literals
    And the transformed code should maintain the original functionality
    And the transformation should record the changes made

  Scenario: Transform code with style issues
    Given I have Python code with style issues
    When I transform the code using the "improve_code_style" transformation
    Then the transformed code should have improved style
    And the transformed code should maintain the original functionality
    And the transformation should record the changes made

  Scenario: Apply multiple transformations to code
    Given I have Python code with multiple issues
    When I transform the code using the following transformations:
      | transformation               |
      | remove_unused_imports        |
      | remove_redundant_assignments |
      | remove_unused_variables      |
      | optimize_string_literals     |
      | improve_code_style           |
    Then the transformed code should address all issues
    And the transformed code should maintain the original functionality
    And the transformation should record all changes made

  Scenario: Transform a file
    Given I have a Python file with code issues
    When I transform the file using the "remove_unused_imports" transformation
    Then the transformed file should not contain unused imports
    And the transformed file should maintain the original functionality
    And the transformation should record the changes made to the file

  Scenario: Transform a directory
    Given I have a directory with Python files
    When I transform the directory using the "remove_unused_imports" transformation
    Then all Python files in the directory should be transformed
    And none of the transformed files should contain unused imports
    And all transformed files should maintain their original functionality
    And the transformation should record the changes made to each file

  Scenario: Transform a directory recursively
    Given I have a directory with Python files and subdirectories
    When I transform the directory recursively using the "remove_unused_imports" transformation
    Then all Python files in the directory and its subdirectories should be transformed
    And none of the transformed files should contain unused imports
    And all transformed files should maintain their original functionality
    And the transformation should record the changes made to each file

  Scenario: Validate syntax before and after transformation
    Given I have Python code with issues
    When I transform the code using the "remove_unused_variables" transformation
    Then the transformer should validate the syntax before transformation
    And the transformer should validate the syntax after transformation
    And the transformation should only proceed if the syntax is valid
    And the transformed code should have valid syntax

  Scenario: Handle syntax errors gracefully
    Given I have Python code with syntax errors
    When I attempt to transform the code
    Then the transformer should detect the syntax errors
    And the transformer should report the syntax errors
    And the transformer should not proceed with the transformation

  Scenario: Integrate with EDRR workflow
    Given the EDRR workflow is configured
    When I initiate a code transformation task
    Then the system should use code transformation in the Refinement phase
    And the system should apply appropriate transformations based on the code analysis
    And the memory system should store transformation results with appropriate EDRR phase tags

  Scenario: Integrate with WSDE team
    Given the WSDE team is configured
    When I assign a code transformation task to the WSDE team
    Then the team should collaborate to transform different aspects of the code
    And the team should share transformation results between agents
    And the team should produce consolidated transformed code
