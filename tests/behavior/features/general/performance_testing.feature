Feature: Performance and Scalability Testing
  As a DevSynth developer
  I want to ensure the system performs well under various conditions
  So that users have a responsive experience even with large projects

  Background:
    Given the DevSynth system is initialized
    And a test project with 100 files is loaded

  Scenario: Memory usage remains within acceptable limits
    When I perform a full project analysis
    Then the peak memory usage should be less than 500MB
    And the memory should be properly released after analysis

  Scenario: Response time for common operations
    When I measure the response time for the following operations:
      | operation                | max_time_ms |
      | project initialization   | 1000        |
      | code analysis            | 2000        |
      | memory query             | 100         |
      | agent solution generation| 5000        |
    Then all operations should complete within their maximum time limits

  Scenario: Scalability with increasing data volumes
    Given test projects of the following sizes:
      | size_description | file_count |
      | small            | 10         |
      | medium           | 100        |
      | large            | 1000       |
    When I perform a full project analysis on each project
    Then the analysis time should scale sub-linearly with project size
    And the memory usage should scale linearly with project size
