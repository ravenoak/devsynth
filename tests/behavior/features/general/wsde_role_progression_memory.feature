Feature: WSDE Role Progression and Memory Semantics
  As a WSDE agent
  I want stable role assignments and consistent memory state
  So that collaboration maintains integrity across EDRR phases

  Background:
    Given a WSDE team with multiple agents
    And EDRR workflow is active

  @fast @reqid-wsde-role-progression-memory
  Scenario: Role assignments use stable agent identifiers
    Given agents are added to the WSDE team
    When role assignments are requested
    Then assignments are keyed by stable agent identifiers
    And role mappings remain consistent across queries
    And agent names do not affect role assignments

  @fast @reqid-wsde-role-progression-memory
  Scenario: Phase progression flushes memory updates
    Given agents have queued memory operations
    When progressing to a new EDRR phase
    Then progress_roles function is invoked
    And queued memory operations are flushed
    And memory state remains consistent across agents

  @fast @reqid-wsde-role-progression-memory
  Scenario: Memory flush operations clear sync queue
    Given memory operations are queued for synchronization
    When flush_memory_queue is called
    Then all queued operations are processed
    And the sync queue is left empty
    And flushed items are returned for verification

  @medium @reqid-wsde-role-progression-memory
  Scenario: Role progression maintains collaboration integrity
    Given agents are collaborating across EDRR phases
    When roles are progressed during phase transitions
    Then all agents maintain consistent shared state
    And memory updates are synchronized before role changes
    And collaboration context remains intact
