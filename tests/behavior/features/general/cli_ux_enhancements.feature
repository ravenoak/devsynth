Feature: CLI UX Enhancements
  As a developer
  I want an improved CLI user experience
  So that I can work more efficiently with DevSynth

  Scenario: Display progress indicators for long-running operations
    Given the CLI is initialized
    When I run a long-running command
    Then I should see a progress indicator
    And the progress indicator should update as the operation progresses
    And the progress indicator should complete when the operation is done

  Scenario: Provide improved error messages
    Given the CLI is initialized
    When I run a command with invalid parameters
    Then I should see a detailed error message
    And the error message should suggest how to fix the issue
    And the error message should include relevant documentation links

  Scenario: Implement command autocompletion
    Given the CLI is initialized with autocompletion
    When I type a partial command and press tab
    Then I should see command completion suggestions
    And I should be able to select a suggestion to complete the command

  Scenario: Show help text with examples
    Given the CLI is initialized
    When I run a command with the --help flag
    Then I should see detailed help text
    And the help text should include usage examples
    And the help text should explain all available options

  Scenario: Provide colorized output
    Given the CLI is initialized
    When I run a command that produces output
    Then the output should be colorized for better readability
    And different types of information should have different colors
    And warnings and errors should be highlighted appropriately
