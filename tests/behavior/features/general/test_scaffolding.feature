Feature: Integration test scaffolding
  As a developer
  I want integration scenarios to produce placeholder tests
  So that interaction coverage is visible early

  Scenario: Scaffold integration tests for scenarios
    Given integration scenarios are defined
    When the test agent generates tests
    Then placeholder integration test files are created
    And the placeholders indicate they require implementation
