Feature: Training Materials for TDD/BDD-EDRR Integration
  As a developer new to DevSynth
  I want comprehensive training materials on the TDD/BDD-EDRR integration
  So that I can quickly adopt the test-first development approach

  Background:
    Given the DevSynth system is initialized
    And the documentation system is available

  Scenario: Access TDD/BDD-EDRR training materials
    When I request training materials on TDD/BDD-EDRR integration
    Then I should receive a comprehensive training guide
    And the guide should include sections on:
      | section                           |
      | Introduction to TDD/BDD           |
      | Overview of EDRR Methodology      |
      | Integration Principles            |
      | Practical Examples                |
      | Exercises and Workshops           |
      | Common Pitfalls and Solutions     |
      | Advanced Topics                   |

  Scenario: Complete interactive TDD/BDD-EDRR workshop
    When I start the interactive TDD/BDD-EDRR workshop
    Then I should be guided through a series of exercises
    And each exercise should demonstrate a specific aspect of the integration
    And I should receive feedback on my progress
    And I should be able to apply the learned concepts to a real project

  Scenario: Generate personalized learning path
    When I provide my current skill level and learning goals
    Then I should receive a personalized learning path for TDD/BDD-EDRR integration
    And the learning path should be tailored to my skill level
    And the learning path should include recommended resources and exercises
    And the learning path should track my progress over time
