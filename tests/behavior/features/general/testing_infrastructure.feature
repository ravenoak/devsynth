Feature: DevSynth Post-MVP Testing Infrastructure
  As a developer
  I want reliable testing infrastructure
  So that code changes are verified automatically

  Scenario: Placeholder scenario
    Given the testing environment is configured
    When tests are executed
    Then results confirm system stability
