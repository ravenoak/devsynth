Feature: Testing Infrastructure
  As a developer
  I want reliable testing infrastructure
  So that code changes are verified automatically

  Background:
    Given the DevSynth system is initialized
    And the testing infrastructure is configured
    And I have a project with tests

  @fast @testing
  Scenario: Execute basic test suite
    Given the testing environment is configured
    When tests are executed
    Then results confirm system stability
    And test execution should complete successfully

  @fast @testing
  Scenario: Validate test collection
    When I collect tests for the project
    Then the system should find unit tests
    And the system should find integration tests
    And the system should find behavior tests
    And test collection should be accurate

  @medium @testing
  Scenario: Enhanced test infrastructure integration
    Given enhanced test infrastructure is enabled
    When I run enhanced test analysis
    Then the system should provide advanced test insights
    And the system should identify test improvement opportunities
    And the system should maintain backward compatibility
    And existing tests should continue to work unchanged

  @fast @testing
  Scenario: Test isolation validation
    Given I have tests that may have isolation issues
    When I validate test isolation
    Then the system should identify potential isolation problems
    And the system should suggest isolation improvements
    And the system should provide isolation recommendations

  @fast @testing
  Scenario: Generate test infrastructure report
    When I generate a test infrastructure report
    Then the report should include test counts by category
    And the report should show test organization metrics
    And the report should provide quality insights
    And the report should suggest improvements
