Feature: AST Workflow Integration
  As a developer using DevSynth
  I want to integrate AST-based code analysis with the EDRR workflow
  So that I can improve code quality throughout the development process

  Background:
    Given the DevSynth system is initialized
    And the AST workflow integration is configured
    And the memory system is initialized

  Scenario: Expand implementation options
    Given I have a code implementation
    When I request to expand implementation options
    Then the system should generate alternative implementations
    And the alternatives should be syntactically valid
    And the alternatives should maintain the original functionality
    And the memory system should store the original and alternative implementations

  Scenario: Differentiate implementation quality
    Given I have multiple code implementations for the same task
    When I request to differentiate implementation quality
    Then the system should analyze each implementation
    And the system should calculate quality metrics for each implementation
    And the system should select the implementation with the highest quality
    And the memory system should store the quality metrics for each implementation

  Scenario: Refine implementation
    Given I have a code implementation that needs improvement
    When I request to refine the implementation
    Then the system should analyze the code for improvement opportunities
    And the system should apply appropriate transformations
    And the refined code should have higher quality metrics
    And the memory system should store the original and refined implementations

  Scenario: Retrospect code quality
    Given I have a code implementation
    When I request to retrospect on code quality
    Then the system should analyze the code quality
    And the system should calculate complexity, readability, and maintainability metrics
    And the system should identify improvement opportunities
    And the system should provide specific recommendations
    And the memory system should store the quality metrics and recommendations

  Scenario: Calculate complexity metrics
    Given I have a code implementation
    When I calculate complexity metrics
    Then the system should analyze the code structure
    And the system should calculate cyclomatic complexity
    And the system should calculate cognitive complexity
    And the system should provide an overall complexity score
    And the complexity score should be between 0 and 1

  Scenario: Calculate readability metrics
    Given I have a code implementation
    When I calculate readability metrics
    Then the system should analyze the code style
    And the system should calculate docstring coverage
    And the system should analyze identifier naming
    And the system should analyze comment quality
    And the system should provide an overall readability score
    And the readability score should be between 0 and 1

  Scenario: Calculate maintainability metrics
    Given I have a code implementation
    When I calculate maintainability metrics
    Then the system should analyze the code structure
    And the system should calculate code duplication
    And the system should calculate function length
    And the system should calculate class cohesion
    And the system should provide an overall maintainability score
    And the maintainability score should be between 0 and 1

  Scenario: Integrate with EDRR Expand phase
    Given the EDRR workflow is configured
    When I initiate the Expand phase for a coding task
    Then the system should use AST workflow to expand implementation options
    And the expanded options should be available for the Differentiate phase
    And the memory system should store the expanded options with the Expand phase tag

  Scenario: Integrate with EDRR Differentiate phase
    Given the EDRR workflow is configured
    And multiple implementation options are available
    When I initiate the Differentiate phase for a coding task
    Then the system should use AST workflow to differentiate implementation quality
    And the highest quality implementation should be selected
    And the memory system should store the differentiation results with the Differentiate phase tag

  Scenario: Integrate with EDRR Refine phase
    Given the EDRR workflow is configured
    And an implementation is selected
    When I initiate the Refine phase for a coding task
    Then the system should use AST workflow to refine the implementation
    And the refined implementation should have higher quality
    And the memory system should store the refined implementation with the Refine phase tag

  Scenario: Integrate with EDRR Retrospect phase
    Given the EDRR workflow is configured
    And an implementation is refined
    When I initiate the Retrospect phase for a coding task
    Then the system should use AST workflow to retrospect on code quality
    And the retrospection should include quality metrics and recommendations
    And the memory system should store the retrospection results with the Retrospect phase tag

  Scenario: Complete EDRR workflow with AST integration
    Given the EDRR workflow is configured
    When I execute a complete EDRR cycle for a coding task
    Then the system should use AST workflow in each phase:
      | Phase        | AST Workflow Function          |
      | Expand       | expand_implementation_options  |
      | Differentiate| differentiate_implementation_quality |
      | Refine       | refine_implementation          |
      | Retrospect   | retrospect_code_quality        |
    And the final implementation should have high quality metrics
    And the memory system should store the results from each phase
