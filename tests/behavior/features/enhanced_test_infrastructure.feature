Feature: Enhanced Test Infrastructure
  As a developer
  I want to use enhanced test infrastructure
  So that I can improve test quality and organization

  Background:
    Given the DevSynth system is initialized
    And the enhanced test infrastructure is configured
    And I have a project with unit and integration tests

  @fast @test-infrastructure
  Scenario: Analyze test isolation issues
    When I run test isolation analysis
    Then I should receive a detailed isolation report
    And the report should identify potential issues
    And the report should provide improvement recommendations
    And the report should categorize issues by severity

  @fast @test-infrastructure
  Scenario: Generate comprehensive test report
    Given I have test results from multiple categories
    When I generate a comprehensive test report
    Then the report should include test counts by category
    And the report should show marker distribution
    And the report should highlight isolation issues
    And the report should be available in multiple formats

  @medium @test-infrastructure
  Scenario: Enhance test quality automatically
    Given I have tests with potential improvements
    When I run test enhancement
    Then the system should identify improvement opportunities
    And the system should apply safe enhancements
    And the system should preserve test functionality
    And the system should report changes made

  @fast @test-infrastructure
  Scenario: Validate enhanced test collection
    When I collect tests using enhanced infrastructure
    Then the collection should include unit tests
    And the collection should include integration tests
    And the collection should include behavior tests
    And the collection should be faster than basic pytest collection

  @medium @test-infrastructure
  Scenario: Analyze test coverage gaps
    Given I have a project with incomplete test coverage
    When I analyze test coverage gaps
    Then the system should identify untested modules
    And the system should identify untested functions
    And the system should identify untested code paths
    And the system should prioritize coverage gaps by importance

  @fast @test-infrastructure
  Scenario: Generate test quality metrics
    When I request test quality metrics
    Then the system should provide test organization metrics
    And the system should provide test isolation metrics
    And the system should provide test enhancement metrics
    And the system should provide coverage improvement suggestions

  @medium @test-infrastructure
  Scenario: Integrate with EDRR workflow
    Given the EDRR workflow is configured
    When I initiate a test infrastructure enhancement task
    Then the system should use enhanced analysis in the Analysis phase
    And the system should use isolation analysis in the Design phase
    And the system should use automated enhancement in the Refinement phase
    And the memory system should store test infrastructure results

  @fast @test-infrastructure
  Scenario: Validate backward compatibility
    Given I have existing pytest-based tests
    When I enable enhanced test infrastructure
    Then existing tests should continue to work unchanged
    And existing test markers should be preserved
    And existing CLI commands should be enhanced rather than replaced
    And new features should be opt-in

  @slow @test-infrastructure
  Scenario: Performance validation for large projects
    Given I have a large project with many tests
    When I run enhanced test infrastructure operations
    Then test collection should complete within performance targets
    And test analysis should complete within performance targets
    And report generation should complete within performance targets
    And resource usage should remain within specified limits

  @fast @test-infrastructure
  Scenario: Generate test infrastructure health report
    When I request a test infrastructure health report
    Then the report should include collection performance metrics
    And the report should include analysis accuracy metrics
    And the report should include enhancement success metrics
    And the report should provide improvement recommendations
