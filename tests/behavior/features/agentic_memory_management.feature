Feature: Agentic Memory Management Specification
  As a DevSynth developer
  I want agents to autonomously manage their cognitive workspace
  So that they can handle long-horizon tasks effectively without human intervention

  Background:
    Given the agentic memory management system is configured
    And DeepAgents integration is enabled
    And the cognitive memory framework is active
    And metacognitive capabilities are operational

  @deepagents_integration @task_decomposition @high_priority
  Scenario: Integrate DeepAgents for enhanced task decomposition
    Given I have a complex development task requiring multiple steps
    When the agent uses DeepAgents' write_todos tool in the EDRR Expand phase
    Then the task should be systematically decomposed into manageable subtasks
    And hierarchical sub-agent spawning should enable context isolation
    And progress tracking should be autonomously monitored
    And task completion should be achieved with improved efficiency

  @context_management @file_system_integration @medium_priority
  Scenario: Manage context through file system integration
    Given I have a task that would exceed context window limits
    When the agent uses file system tools for context offloading
    Then large tool outputs should be stored externally
    And context window overflow should be prevented
    And persistent context should be maintained across sessions
    And memory efficiency should be optimized

  @long_term_memory @langgraph_integration @medium_priority
  Scenario: Bridge to long-term memory systems
    Given the agent has accumulated knowledge across sessions
    When LangGraph store integration is active
    Then cross-session continuity should be maintained
    And critical architectural decisions should persist
    And knowledge preservation should work reliably
    And state coherence should be ensured

  @cognitive_memory_types @four_memory_types @medium_priority
  Scenario: Manage four distinct memory types
    Given the cognitive memory framework is operational
    When different types of information are processed
    Then parametric memory should handle encoded knowledge
    And contextual memory should manage active working memory
    And external memory should persist knowledge in stores
    And episodic/procedural memory should track interaction history
    And memory types should remain consistent and accessible

  @agentic_compaction @memory_optimization @medium_priority
  Scenario: Perform autonomous memory compaction
    Given the agent has accumulated conversation history
    When periodic summarization is triggered
    Then conversation history should be condensed effectively
    And essential information should be preserved
    And working memory should be reset with summaries
    And context quality should be maintained

  @structured_note_taking @external_memory @low_priority
  Scenario: Create and manage structured notes autonomously
    Given the agent encounters information requiring external storage
    When strategic recording decisions are made
    Then an agentic scratchpad should be created
    And relevant information should be externalized
    And seamless retrieval should be available during tasks
    And memory organization should improve

  @sub_agent_architecture @task_isolation @low_priority
  Scenario: Utilize sub-agent architectures for complex tasks
    Given a complex problem requires specialization
    When hierarchical sub-agent spawning occurs
    Then the problem should be decomposed into specialized subtasks
    And manager agents should coordinate worker agents
    And clean context boundaries should be maintained
    And task execution should be more efficient

  @ace_framework @self_evolution @low_priority
  Scenario: Enable self-evolving context systems
    Given the ACE framework is operational
    When agents modify prompts based on execution outcomes
    Then feedback-driven refinement should occur
    And iterative improvement should be demonstrated
    And performance self-assessment should work
    And context quality should improve over time

  @a_mem_organization @autonomous_structure @low_priority
  Scenario: Create autonomous memory organization
    Given the A-Mem system is active
    When agents create links between memories
    Then self-structuring should occur without predefined schemas
    And organic knowledge graphs should emerge
    And contextual descriptions should be self-generated
    And memory organization should be task-relevant

  @attention_budget @resource_management @low_priority
  Scenario: Manage attention budget autonomously
    Given the agent has limited attention resources
    When dynamic allocation is required
    Then information priority should be adjusted by task requirements
    And signal-to-noise optimization should occur
    And resource awareness should be maintained
    And computational costs should be optimized

  @context_curation @self_management @low_priority
  Scenario: Perform autonomous context self-curation
    Given the agent has diverse information sources
    When relevance assessment occurs
    Then information value should be evaluated for current tasks
    And format optimization should improve comprehension
    And progressive refinement should enhance quality
    And context effectiveness should increase
