Feature: Agentic Memory Management
    As a DevSynth agent
    I want autonomous memory and context curation
    So that I can self-optimize my cognitive workspace

    @fast @cognitive-memory
    Scenario: Four memory types integration
        Given an agent with cognitive memory framework
        When managing different types of information
        Then it should utilize parametric memory for trained knowledge
        And leverage contextual memory for working attention budget
        And access external memory for persistent knowledge
        And maintain episodic memory for interaction history

    @medium @compaction
    Scenario: Autonomous context compaction
        Given an agent in a long-running conversation
        When context approaches attention budget limits
        Then it should autonomously trigger compaction
        And summarize conversation history
        And preserve essential information and decisions
        And reset working context with condensed summary
        And maintain task continuity

    @medium @structured-notes
    Scenario: Agentic structured note-taking
        Given an agent working on complex tasks
        When identifying important intermediate information
        Then it should autonomously decide to externalize key details
        And create structured notes in agentic scratchpad
        And establish meaningful relationships between notes
        And retrieve relevant notes when needed
        And track progress across task phases

    @slow @sub-agent-coordination
    Scenario: Sub-agent architecture management
        Given a complex task requiring diverse expertise
        When the primary agent decomposes the problem
        Then it should create specialized sub-agents
        And allocate clean context to each sub-agent
        And coordinate sub-agent execution
        And synthesize results from all sub-agents
        And prevent context pollution at the top level

    @medium @self-evolution
    Scenario: Context template self-evolution
        Given an agent with self-evolution capabilities
        When analyzing performance across multiple tasks
        Then it should identify successful context patterns
        And refine context templates based on feedback
        And autonomously improve context configurations
        And demonstrate enhanced performance over time

    @fast @metacognition
    Scenario: Metacognitive attention management
        Given an agent with metacognitive capabilities
        When processing information streams
        Then it should dynamically allocate attention budget
        And assess information relevance autonomously
        And optimize context format for comprehension
        And adapt strategies based on task requirements

    @slow @long-horizon-state
    Scenario: Long-horizon state persistence
        Given extended multi-session interactions
        When maintaining coherence across sessions
        Then it should persist critical state information
        And track progress across session boundaries
        And learn from interaction patterns
        And adapt behavior based on accumulated experience

    @medium @error-recovery
    Scenario: Autonomous error recovery
        Given failures in task execution
        When analyzing error patterns
        Then it should identify context-related failure modes
        And modify context management strategies
        And implement corrective approaches
        And prevent recurrence of similar failures

    @fast @safety-mechanisms
    Scenario: Safety and alignment verification
        Given autonomous memory management
        When making critical decisions
        Then it should maintain human oversight capabilities
        And detect potential bias amplification
        And verify alignment with system goals
        And provide intervention points for critical actions

    @medium @wsde-integration
    Scenario: WSDE model agentic enhancement
        Given WSDE collaborative framework
        When integrating agentic memory capabilities
        Then Primus should have full context engineering authority
        And Workers should optimize task-specific contexts
        And Supervisors should monitor context quality
        And Designers should leverage reasoning examples
        And Evaluators should assess context effectiveness
