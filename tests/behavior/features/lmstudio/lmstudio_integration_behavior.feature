# LM Studio Integration Behavior Tests
# Related issue: LM Studio provider configuration and usage

Feature: LM Studio provider integration
  As a developer using DevSynth
  I want to configure and use LM Studio as an LLM provider
  So that I can run DevSynth with local language models

  Background:
    Given DevSynth is properly installed and configured

  @fast @reqid-lmstudio-behavior-1
  Scenario: Configure LM Studio as default provider
    Given the configuration specifies LM Studio as the default LLM provider
    When I initialize DevSynth with LM Studio configuration
    Then LM Studio should be selected as the active provider
    And LM Studio provider should be properly initialized

  @fast @reqid-lmstudio-behavior-2
  Scenario: Handle LM Studio unavailability gracefully
    Given LM Studio is not running or unavailable
    When I attempt to use LM Studio provider
    Then DevSynth should handle the connection error gracefully
    And provide appropriate fallback behavior

  @fast @reqid-lmstudio-behavior-3
  Scenario: Generate text with LM Studio provider
    Given LM Studio is available and configured
    And a valid model is loaded in LM Studio
    When I request text generation with a prompt
    Then LM Studio should generate a response
    And the response should be returned to DevSynth

  @fast @reqid-lmstudio-behavior-4
  Scenario: Generate text with context using LM Studio
    Given LM Studio is available and configured
    And I have conversation context
    When I request context-aware text generation
    Then LM Studio should consider the conversation history
    And generate a contextually appropriate response

  @fast @reqid-lmstudio-behavior-5
  Scenario: Configure LM Studio provider settings
    Given I need to customize LM Studio provider settings
    When I specify configuration options for LM Studio
    Then the provider should use the specified settings
    And apply them correctly during initialization

  @fast @reqid-lmstudio-behavior-6
  Scenario: Validate LM Studio provider health
    Given LM Studio provider is configured
    When I check the provider health status
    Then the health check should return appropriate status
    And indicate whether LM Studio is accessible

  @fast @reqid-lmstudio-behavior-7
  Scenario: Handle LM Studio configuration errors
    Given invalid LM Studio configuration is provided
    When I attempt to initialize the LM Studio provider
    Then DevSynth should detect the configuration errors
    And provide clear error messages for troubleshooting

  @fast @reqid-lmstudio-behavior-8
  Scenario: Fallback to alternative providers
    Given LM Studio is configured as primary provider but unavailable
    When I request LLM services
    Then DevSynth should fallback to alternative providers
    And continue operation with reduced functionality
