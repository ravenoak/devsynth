Feature: Cursor IDE Integration with DevSynth
    As a developer using DevSynth
    I want seamless integration with Cursor IDE
    So that I can leverage structured AI assistance within my development workflow

    Background:
        Given DevSynth is properly configured
        And Cursor IDE is installed and running
        And the project has Cursor integration enabled

    @integration @edrr_workflow
    Scenario: EDRR-enhanced development workflow
        Given I am implementing a new feature using Cursor IDE
        When I use the expand-phase command to generate multiple approaches
        Then I should receive diverse implementation strategies
        And each approach should be evaluated against project requirements
        When I use the differentiate-phase command to compare approaches
        Then I should receive structured comparison with trade-off analysis
        And a clear recommendation should be provided
        When I use the refine-phase command to implement the selected approach
        Then production-ready code should be generated
        And comprehensive tests should be created
        And documentation should be updated
        When I use the retrospect-phase command to analyze the implementation
        Then learnings should be captured and documented
        And process improvements should be suggested

    @specification_driven @bdd
    Scenario: Specification-driven development with Cursor
        Given I have a feature idea that needs implementation
        When I use the generate-specification command
        Then a comprehensive specification should be created in docs/specifications/
        And BDD scenarios should be generated in tests/behavior/features/
        And acceptance criteria should be clearly defined
        When I use the validate-bdd-scenarios command
        Then scenario syntax should be validated
        And content quality should be assessed
        And implementation feasibility should be confirmed

    @testing @quality_assurance
    Scenario: Comprehensive testing with Cursor assistance
        Given I have implemented a new component
        When I use the generate-test-suite command
        Then unit tests should be created in tests/unit/
        And integration tests should be created in tests/integration/
        And BDD scenarios should be added to tests/behavior/features/
        And appropriate speed markers should be applied
        When I use the code-review command
        Then code quality should be assessed
        And architecture compliance should be verified
        And security vulnerabilities should be identified
        And improvement suggestions should be provided

    @custom_modes @productivity
    Scenario: Custom modes enhance development workflow
        Given I am working on a complex implementation task
        When I activate EDRRImplementer mode
        Then I should receive structured implementation guidance
        And code should be generated following project patterns
        And comprehensive tests should be created automatically
        And quality gates should be validated
        When I switch to SpecArchitect mode
        Then I should receive specification creation assistance
        And BDD scenarios should be generated with proper syntax
        And requirements traceability should be maintained

    @dialectical_reasoning @decision_making
    Scenario: Dialectical reasoning enhances decision quality
        Given I need to make an architectural decision
        When I use DialecticalThinker mode
        Then multiple perspectives should be considered
        And thesis-antithesis-synthesis reasoning should be applied
        And trade-offs should be clearly analyzed
        And consensus-building should be facilitated
        When I use CodeReviewer mode
        Then comprehensive code analysis should be performed
        And quality metrics should be calculated
        And improvement recommendations should be provided
        And compliance with project standards should be verified

    @configuration @setup
    Scenario: Cursor integration configuration
        Given I am setting up Cursor integration for a new project
        When I copy the .cursor directory structure
        And configure the project.yaml file
        And set up custom modes
        Then Cursor rules should be active and guiding AI behavior
        And commands should be available in the chat interface
        And modes should be accessible via keybindings
        When I start development with Cursor IDE
        Then I should receive context-aware assistance
        And specifications should be easily accessible
        And development workflow should be structured and guided

    @quality_gates @validation
    Scenario: Quality assurance through Cursor integration
        Given I have completed a feature implementation
        When I run comprehensive code review
        And validate all BDD scenarios
        And check security compliance
        And verify testing coverage
        Then all critical issues should be identified and resolved
        And quality metrics should meet project standards
        And documentation should be complete and accurate
        And the implementation should be ready for deployment

    @continuous_improvement @learning
    Scenario: Learning integration and process improvement
        Given I have completed a development cycle
        When I use the retrospect-phase command
        And analyze the development process
        And capture lessons learned
        Then process improvements should be identified
        And best practices should be documented
        And future development should benefit from learnings
        When I start a new feature
        Then improved patterns should be suggested
        And previous learnings should be applied
        And development efficiency should be enhanced
