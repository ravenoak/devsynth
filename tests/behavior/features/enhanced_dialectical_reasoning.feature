Feature: Enhanced Dialectical Reasoning
  As a developer using DevSynth
  I want to use enhanced dialectical reasoning capabilities
  So that I can generate more comprehensive and nuanced solutions

  Background:
    Given the DevSynth system is initialized
    And a team of agents is configured
    And the WSDE model is enabled
    And a Critic agent with dialectical reasoning expertise is added to the team

  Scenario: Multi-stage dialectical reasoning process
    When a solution is proposed for a complex task
    Then the Critic agent should apply multi-stage dialectical reasoning
    And the reasoning should include thesis identification
    And the reasoning should include antithesis generation with multiple critique categories
    And the reasoning should include synthesis creation that addresses all critiques
    And the reasoning should include a final evaluation of the synthesis

  Scenario: Comprehensive critique categories
    When a solution is proposed for a complex task
    Then the Critic agent should analyze the solution across multiple dimensions
    And the critique should include security considerations
    And the critique should include performance considerations
    And the critique should include maintainability considerations
    And the critique should include usability considerations
    And the critique should include testability considerations

  Scenario: Dialectical reasoning with multiple solutions
    Given multiple solutions are proposed for a task
    When dialectical reasoning is applied to compare the solutions
    Then each solution should be analyzed as a potential thesis
    And comparative critiques should be generated
    And a synthesized solution should incorporate the best elements of each proposal
    And the final solution should be superior to any individual proposal

  Scenario: Dialectical reasoning with external knowledge integration
    Given external knowledge sources are available
    And a solution is proposed for a complex task
    When dialectical reasoning with external knowledge is applied
    Then the reasoning should incorporate relevant external knowledge
    And the critique should reference industry best practices
    And the synthesis should align with external standards
    And the evaluation should consider compliance with external requirements
