Feature: DevSynth Specification MVP Updated
  As a maintainer
  I want the MVP specification to reflect the latest scope
  So that development efforts target agreed priorities

  Scenario: Placeholder scenario
    Given the MVP specification has been revised
    When contributors align their tasks
    Then work items match the updated scope
