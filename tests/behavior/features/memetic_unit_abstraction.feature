Feature: Memetic Unit Abstraction for Universal Memory Representation
  As a DevSynth developer
  I want a universal memory representation with rich metadata
  So that all information can be consistently processed and retrieved

  Background:
    Given the Memetic Unit system is configured and initialized
    And metadata validation is enabled
    And cognitive type classification is active
    And memory backends are adapted for Memetic Units

  @memetic_unit_creation @metadata_schema @high_priority
  Scenario: Create Memetic Unit with comprehensive metadata
    Given I have raw data from various sources
    When I process the data through the ingestion pipeline
    Then a valid Memetic Unit should be created
    And all metadata fields should be populated correctly
    And the cognitive type should be classified appropriately
    And semantic descriptors should be generated
    And the content hash should be computed
    And governance fields should be initialized

  @cognitive_type_classification @source_routing @medium_priority
  Scenario: Classify data into appropriate cognitive types
    Given I have data from different sources
    When the system classifies the cognitive type
    Then user input should be classified as WORKING memory
    And code execution results should be classified as EPISODIC memory
    And documentation should be classified as SEMANTIC memory
    And API responses should be classified as PROCEDURAL memory
    And classification should be deterministic and consistent

  @metadata_governance @lifecycle_management @medium_priority
  Scenario: Manage Memetic Unit lifecycle and governance
    Given I have Memetic Units with different ages and access patterns
    When the governance system processes the units
    Then salience scores should be updated based on usage
    And confidence scores should reflect data quality
    And expired units should be identified correctly
    And access patterns should influence retention decisions
    And governance should not affect unit functionality

  @content_deduplication @hash_consistency @medium_priority
  Scenario: Deduplicate identical content across memory backends
    Given I have identical content stored in multiple backends
    When the deduplication system processes the content
    Then identical content should be identified with >99% accuracy
    And content hashes should be consistent across backends
    And duplicate units should be merged appropriately
    And metadata should be preserved during deduplication
    And storage efficiency should be improved

  @semantic_enhancement @vector_generation @low_priority
  Scenario: Generate semantic vectors and descriptors for content
    Given I have diverse content types (text, code, structured data)
    When the semantic enhancement processes the content
    Then semantic vectors should be generated for each unit
    And keywords should be extracted accurately
    And topics should be classified correctly
    And content similarity should be computable
    And semantic search should work across modalities

  @temporal_tracking @causal_relationships @low_priority
  Scenario: Track temporal sequences and causal relationships
    Given I have a sequence of related Memetic Units
    When the temporal tracking system processes the sequence
    Then timestamps should be recorded accurately
    And causal relationships should be established
    And temporal queries should return correct sequences
    And aging should be calculated correctly
    And access patterns should be tracked over time

  @cross_backend_consistency @integration @low_priority
  Scenario: Maintain consistency across multiple memory backends
    Given I have Memetic Units stored across vector, graph, and document backends
    When I update a unit in one backend
    Then the changes should be reflected in other backends
    And consistency checks should pass
    And cross-backend queries should return consistent results
    And metadata should remain synchronized
    And performance should not be significantly degraded

  @quality_management @confidence_scoring @low_priority
  Scenario: Manage information quality and confidence over time
    Given I have Memetic Units with varying quality and confidence
    When the quality management system processes the units
    Then confidence scores should be calculated accurately
    And quality degradation should be tracked
    And low-confidence units should be flagged
    And quality improvements should be suggested
    And validation should be performed continuously
