Feature: Error Handling
  As a developer
  I want DevSynth to handle errors gracefully
  So that I can understand and resolve issues easily

  Background:
    Given the DevSynth CLI is installed

  Scenario: Handle missing project directory
    Given I am in a directory without a DevSynth project
    When I run the command "devsynth spec --requirements-file requirements.md"
    Then the system should detect the missing project
    And display an appropriate error message
    And exit with a non-zero status code

  Scenario: Handle invalid file paths
    Given I have a valid DevSynth project
    When I run the command "devsynth spec --requirements-file nonexistent.md"
    Then the system should detect the missing file
    And display an appropriate error message
    And exit with a non-zero status code

  Scenario: Handle invalid configuration
    Given I have a valid DevSynth project
    When I run the command "devsynth config --key invalid_key --value test"
    Then the system should detect the invalid configuration key
    And display an appropriate error message
    And exit with a non-zero status code

  Scenario: Recover from workflow errors
    Given I have a valid DevSynth project
    And a previous workflow failed
    When I fix the issue that caused the failure
    And run the same command again
    Then the workflow should execute successfully
    And the system should display a success message

  Scenario: Handle network errors
    Given I have a valid DevSynth project
    And the network connection is unavailable
    When I run a command that requires network access
    Then the system should detect the network issue
    And display an appropriate error message
    And suggest offline alternatives if available
