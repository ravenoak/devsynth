# This test intentionally defines a behavior-like test without an explicit speed marker.
# We simulate a pytest-bdd scenario wrapper by placing it under tests/behavior/ and relying
# on tests/conftest.py's pytest_collection_modifyitems to auto-inject exactly one speed marker.
#
# The guardrail: ensure exactly one of {fast, medium, slow} is present at runtime.
