## Overview

This is a summary of the requirements created for testing.

## Key Requirements

- The system shall allow users to register with email and password
- The system shall allow users to log in with their credentials
- The system shall allow users to reset their password

## Potential Issues

- Requirement clarity: Some requirements may need further clarification.
- Scope definition: The scope of the project may need to be better defined.

## Recommendations

- Implement the requirements as specified.
- Consider adding more detailed acceptance criteria.
- Review the requirements with stakeholders.
