# Cross-Interface Consistency Testing

This directory contains step definitions for BDD tests that verify the consistency of behavior across different interfaces (CLI, WebUI, Agent API) in the DevSynth project.

## Key Files

- `cross_interface_consistency_extended_steps.py`: Comprehensive step definitions for testing cross-interface consistency
- `uxbridge_steps.py`: Basic step definitions for testing UXBridge functionality
- `uxbridge_shared_steps.py`: Step definitions for testing shared behavior between CLI and WebUI

## Cross-Interface Consistency Testing

The extended cross-interface consistency tests verify that:

1. **Command Execution**: Commands are executed with identical arguments across all interfaces
2. **Error Handling**: Errors are handled consistently across all interfaces
3. **User Input**: User input is processed consistently across all interfaces

### Test Scenarios

The tests cover the following scenarios:

- Commands executed through shared bridge (init, spec, test, code, doctor, edrr_cycle)
- Error handling consistency across interfaces
- User input handling consistency across interfaces

### Running the Tests

To run the cross-interface consistency tests:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/behavior/test_cross_interface_consistency_extended.py -v
```

## Best Practices

When adding new tests or modifying existing ones, follow these best practices:

1. **Isolation**: Each test should be isolated and not depend on the state from other tests
2. **Mocking**: Use mocks for external dependencies to ensure tests are fast and reliable
3. **Assertions**: Include meaningful assertions that verify the expected behavior
4. **Documentation**: Add docstrings to explain the purpose of each step
5. **Naming**: Use clear and descriptive names for step functions

## Adding New Tests

To add new cross-interface consistency tests:

1. Add new scenarios to `cross_interface_consistency_extended.feature`
2. Implement the corresponding step definitions in `cross_interface_consistency_extended_steps.py`
3. Update the test file to register the new scenarios
