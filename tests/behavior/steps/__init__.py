"""Behavior test step definitions package.

All step modules are imported when this package is loaded so that pytest-bdd
can register every step definition.  The previous lazy-import approach caused
``StepDefinitionNotFound`` errors when step modules were not referenced
explicitly in test files.  Importing everything eagerly keeps collection
reliable without a noticeable performance impact.

Pytest plugin exports now live in :mod:`tests.pytest_plugin_registry` and are
loaded from :mod:`tests.conftest`, matching pytest 8's guidance for
centralized plugin declarations.
