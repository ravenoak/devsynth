# Generated Test Scaffolds

This directory contains integration test scaffolds produced by `TestAgent`.

## Review Workflow
1. Review each scaffold file for accuracy and completeness.
2. Replace placeholder logic with real assertions and interactions.
3. Remove the `pytest.skip` marker once the test is ready to run.
4. Commit the verified test to replace the scaffold.

Scaffolds are overwritten on each generation, so move completed tests elsewhere
before re-running generators.
