```

## Manual Test Execution

For comprehensive validation, execute these scenarios manually to experience the full user journey:

### Manual Test 1: Task Manager CLI

#### Setup
```bash
# IMPORTANT: DevSynth commands must be run from the DevSynth project directory for v0.1.0a1
# Create test directory but execute DevSynth from the project root

# Step 1: Set up test directory
mkdir /tmp/devsynth_manual_test_task_manager
TEST_DIR="/tmp/devsynth_manual_test_task_manager"

# Step 2: Get DevSynth project path (adjust as needed)
DEVSYNTH_PROJECT="/Users/caitlyn/Projects/github.com/ravenoak/devsynth"

# Step 3: Validate DevSynth is accessible
cd "$DEVSYNTH_PROJECT"
poetry run devsynth --help > /dev/null || {
    echo "ERROR: DevSynth not accessible from project directory"
    exit 1
}
```

#### Step-by-Step Execution

**Step 1: Initialize Project**
```bash
# Get DevSynth venv path (one-time setup)
cd "$DEVSYNTH_PROJECT"
DEVSYNTH_VENV="$(poetry env info --path)"

# Navigate to test directory and initialize
cd "$TEST_DIR"
echo -e "\n\npython\n\ny" | $DEVSYNTH_VENV/bin/devsynth init

# Alternative: Interactive mode
# $DEVSYNTH_VENV/bin/devsynth init
# Then provide inputs when prompted
```

**User Inputs to Provide:**
- When prompted for project name: `Task Manager CLI`
- When prompted for description: `A command-line task management application with priority levels and persistence`
- When prompted for primary language: `Python`
- When prompted for project type: `CLI Application`
- When prompted for additional features: `JSON persistence, priority levels, due dates`

**Expected Outcomes:**
- `.devsynth/project.yaml` created with correct metadata
- Basic project structure initialized
- No error messages during initialization

**Step 2: Create Requirements**
```bash
cat > requirements.md << 'EOF'

EOF
```

**Step 3: Generate Specifications**
```bash
poetry run devsynth spec --requirements-file requirements.md
```

**Expected DevSynth Interactions:**
- DevSynth analyzes requirements and may ask clarifying questions
- Example prompts and suggested responses:

**Potential DevSynth Question**: "I see you want a CLI application with JSON persistence. Should we use a specific CLI framework?"
**Suggested User Response**: "Use Typer for modern Python CLI with automatic help generation and type validation"

**Potential DevSynth Question**: "For the priority sorting, should completed tasks be shown separately or mixed with active tasks?"
**Suggested User Response**: "Show completed tasks at the bottom, separated from active tasks, with a different visual indicator"

**Potential DevSynth Question**: "What should happen when the JSON file is corrupted or missing?"
**Suggested User Response**: "Create a backup of corrupted files and start with an empty task list, showing a warning message to the user"

**Expected Outcomes:**
- `specs.md` file created with detailed technical specifications
- Specifications include data models, CLI command structure, and storage format
- Error handling scenarios clearly defined
- User interface specifications with command examples

**Step 4: Generate Tests**
```bash
poetry run devsynth test --spec-file specs.md
```

**Expected DevSynth Interactions:**

**Potential DevSynth Question**: "Should we include integration tests for the JSON file operations?"
**Suggested User Response**: "Yes, include integration tests using temporary directories to test file I/O without affecting the user's actual data"

**Potential DevSynth Question**: "What level of test coverage should we target for this application?"
**Suggested User Response**: "Target 85% coverage focusing on business logic, with comprehensive testing of error conditions and edge cases"

**Potential DevSynth Question**: "Should we include performance tests for large task lists?"
**Suggested User Response**: "Include basic performance tests to ensure the application handles up to 1000 tasks efficiently"

**Expected Outcomes:**
- `tests/` directory with comprehensive test suite
- Unit tests for task model, CLI commands, and storage operations
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows with temporary files
- Mock data and fixtures for testing various scenarios

**Step 5: Generate Implementation**
```bash
poetry run devsynth code
```

**Expected DevSynth Interactions:**

**Potential DevSynth Question**: "Should we create a package structure or keep everything in a single module?"
**Suggested User Response**: "Create a package structure with separate modules: models.py for data classes, cli.py for command interface, storage.py for persistence, and main.py for entry point"

**Potential DevSynth Question**: "What should be the default behavior when no tasks exist?"
**Suggested User Response**: "Display a friendly message suggesting how to add the first task, with an example command"

**Potential DevSynth Question**: "Should we include configuration options for the storage location?"
**Suggested User Response**: "Yes, allow override via TASK_MANAGER_DATA_DIR environment variable, but default to ~/.task_manager/"

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Complete Python package with proper structure
- All CLI commands implemented with Typer
- JSON storage system with error handling
- Type hints and docstrings throughout
- Proper logging configuration

**Step 6: Run and Validate**
```bash
poetry run devsynth run-pipeline
```

**Manual Validation Steps:**
1. **Test Installation**: Verify the application can be installed and imported
2. **Test CLI Help**: Run `python -m task_manager --help` to see command options
3. **Test Add Command**: Add several tasks with different priorities and due dates
4. **Test List Command**: Verify tasks display correctly with proper sorting
5. **Test Complete Command**: Mark tasks as completed and verify status changes
6. **Test Delete Command**: Remove tasks and verify they're gone
7. **Test Persistence**: Exit and restart application, verify data persists
8. **Test Error Handling**: Try invalid commands and verify helpful error messages

**Expected Final Validation:**
- [ ] All CLI commands work as specified
- [ ] Data persists correctly between sessions
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and actionable
- [ ] Task sorting works correctly (priority then date)
- [ ] File I/O errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Generated tests pass with good coverage
- [ ] Code follows Python best practices
