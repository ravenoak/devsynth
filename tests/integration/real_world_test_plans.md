# DevSynth Real-World Test Plans

**Author**: DevSynth Testing Team  
**Date**: 2024-09-24  
**Version**: v0.1.0a1  
**Status**: Ready for Execution

## Overview

This document contains comprehensive test plans for validating DevSynth's end-to-end functionality through real-world application development scenarios. Each test case simulates a complete user journey from project initialization to working application deployment.

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Method 1: Using Poetry from DevSynth project directory (RECOMMENDED for v0.1.0a1)
cd /path/to/devsynth/project
poetry install --with dev --extras "tests retrieval chromadb api"
poetry run devsynth doctor  # Validate environment
poetry run devsynth --help  # Confirm CLI accessibility

# Method 2: Using direct venv path (RECOMMENDED for external directory execution)
DEVSYNTH_PROJECT="/path/to/devsynth"  # Adjust to your DevSynth location
DEVSYNTH_VENV="$(cd $DEVSYNTH_PROJECT && poetry env info --path)"
$DEVSYNTH_VENV/bin/devsynth --help  # Test from any directory

# Method 3: Using pipx (TESTED but has dependency issues for v0.1.0a1)
# pipx install --python /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 --include-deps -e ".[tests,retrieval,chromadb,api]"
# Note: Still has transitive dependency resolution issues (missing toml, tinydb, etc.)
# Recommended for post-alpha releases when dependency packaging is improved
```

### **CRITICAL**: Execution Context for v0.1.0a1 âœ… RESOLVED
- **SOLUTION FOUND**: Direct venv path approach works perfectly from any directory
- **Test creation directories can be anywhere** - full flexibility achieved
- **Recommended approach**: Use `DEVSYNTH_VENV="$(cd /path/to/devsynth && poetry env info --path)"` then `$DEVSYNTH_VENV/bin/devsynth` from any directory
- **pipx approach**: Your suggested `--python --include-deps -e .` approach works for installation but has minor dependency resolution issues for complex DevSynth dependency tree

### Test Data Preparation
- Create isolated test directories for each scenario
- Ensure clean environment (no existing .devsynth directories)
- Set appropriate environment variables for offline testing

## Test Case 1: Task Management CLI Application
