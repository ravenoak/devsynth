# DevSynth Development Plan

**Date:** 2023-07-15  
**Author:** GitHub Copilot

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive plan for continuing the development of DevSynth using a multi-disciplined best-practices approach with dialectical reasoning. The plan synthesizes insights from software engineering, artificial intelligence, knowledge management, cognitive science, and collaborative systems to create a cohesive strategy that balances theoretical rigor with practical execution.

## 1. Overview
This document synthesizes a dialectical, multi-discipline review of the entire DevSynth workspace—code, docs, tests, features—and outlines a clear, actionable roadmap for the next phase: "Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect". This updated plan serves as a living document to align all stakeholders, eliminate ambiguity, and ensure DevSynth itself can fully ingest and analyze this project.

DevSynth has established a solid foundation with several key components:

1. **WSDE Agent Model**: A collaborative agent system with peer-based interactions
2. **Multi-Layered Memory Architecture**: Tiered storage with vector, graph, and document capabilities
3. **AST-Based Code Analysis**: Tools for parsing and manipulating code structure
4. **EDRR Workflow Framework**: Structured approach to problem-solving
5. **Prompt Management System**: Templates and evaluation for LLM interactions
6. **Documentation Management**: Version-aware documentation handling

No instances of deprecated Pydantic V1 style validators or configuration classes were found. The settings.py file is correctly using the new Pydantic V2 style.

### 1.0 Dialectical Framework for Development

All development activities follow a structured dialectical reasoning process that ensures thorough examination of design decisions from multiple perspectives before implementation. This approach leads to more robust and well-considered solutions that balance theoretical rigor with practical execution.

#### 1.0.0 Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis Methodology

Each feature implementation follows this structured dialectical reasoning process:

1. **Thesis Phase**: 
   - Document initial design proposal with clear requirements
   - Create initial implementation plan
   - Identify key components and interfaces
   - Develop preliminary test cases (following TDD/BDD principles)

2. **Antithesis Phase**:
   - Critically examine limitations of the initial design
   - Identify potential edge cases and failure modes
   - Consider alternative approaches and implementations
   - Evaluate trade-offs between different solutions
   - Challenge assumptions in the initial design
   - Apply perspectives from multiple disciplines

3. **Synthesis Phase**:
   - Develop refined implementation that resolves identified contradictions
   - Incorporate the best elements from different approaches
   - Ensure the solution addresses all identified edge cases
   - Create comprehensive test suite covering all scenarios
   - Document the reasoning process and decisions made
   - Validate the solution against requirements and constraints

The multi-disciplined approach incorporates best practices from:
- Software engineering (hexagonal architecture, TDD/BDD)
- Artificial intelligence (agent systems, prompt engineering)
- Knowledge management (semantic networks, vector embeddings)
- Cognitive science (memory models, dialectical reasoning)
- Systems thinking (integration, emergent properties)

#### 1.0.1 Integration with TDD/BDD Methodology

The dialectical reasoning process is fully integrated with the TDD/BDD methodology:

1. **Thesis Phase and Test-First Development**:
   - Write behavior tests (BDD scenarios) that define acceptance criteria
   - Create unit tests that specify component behavior
   - Use these tests to drive the initial design proposal

2. **Antithesis Phase and Test Refinement**:
   - Identify edge cases and add tests for them
   - Refine existing tests based on deeper understanding
   - Use tests to evaluate alternative approaches

3. **Synthesis Phase and Test-Driven Implementation**:
   - Implement code to pass the tests
   - Refactor for quality while maintaining test coverage
   - Add integration tests to verify component interactions
   - Document the relationship between tests and implementation

This integration ensures that all development follows a test-first approach while benefiting from the critical examination and synthesis of the dialectical reasoning process.

## 1.A Phase Status (Updated: 2023-07-03)
*   **Current Phase:** Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect
*   **Current Sub-Phase:** Refine & Expand Core
*   **Rationale:** The immediate focus is on solidifying the project's foundations (documentation, testing, code hygiene) while concurrently expanding critical core functionalities. Significant progress has been made on test isolation, error handling, and the Promise System. New focus areas include WSDE model refinement, memory and knowledge architecture enhancement, AST-based code analysis, EDRR workflow integration, prompt management, evaluation frameworks, and version-aware documentation management, based on a multi-disciplined best-practices approach with dialectical reasoning.
*   **Integration Focus:** The current priority is to knit all features together into a cohesive and functional whole. This includes integrating the WSDE model with the memory system, connecting AST-based code analysis with EDRR workflows, implementing DPSy-AI for prompt management across all agents, and ensuring version-aware documentation management is available throughout the system. Based on a comprehensive review of the codebase, significant progress has been made on implementing individual components, but further work is needed to fully integrate them and ensure they work together seamlessly.

## 1.B Feature Integration Plan (Updated: 2023-07-04)
*   **Current Status:** Significant progress has been made on individual components (WSDE model, memory system, code analysis, EDRR workflow, etc.), and some integration work has begun. The WSDE Model and Memory System Integration has seen substantial progress with the implementation of the `WSDEMemoryIntegration` class, which includes methods for storing and retrieving WSDE team state, solutions with EDRR phase tagging, dialectical reasoning results, and querying the knowledge graph. However, the BDD tests for these features are not passing, indicating that there may be issues with the implementation or the tests themselves. The memory system has been enhanced with multiple backends (ChromaDB, DuckDB, FAISS, JSON, LMDB, RDFLib, TinyDB) and a multi-layered architecture. AST-based code analysis is implemented through the `AstVisitor` class, and AST-based code transformation capabilities have been added through the `AstTransformer` class, which provides methods for renaming identifiers, extracting functions, and adding docstrings. The `PromptManager` class provides a foundation for DPSy-AI prompt management with template management, versioning, and reflection capabilities, but integration with agents and some advanced features like dynamic tuning and automatic prompt improvement need to be completed. The `DocumentationManager` class implements version-aware documentation management with version-aware documentation fetching, storage, and querying, but some features like the hybrid retrieval system that combines semantic and symbolic search are not fully implemented. The EDRR workflow has a base implementation (`BaseMethodologyAdapter`) and specific adapters (e.g., `AdHocAdapter`), but the `EDRRCoordinator` for orchestrating all components according to the EDRR pattern is planned but not yet implemented. BDD feature files have been created for all integration areas, providing a clear testing strategy for the remaining implementation work. The integration continues to follow a TDD/BDD approach, with tests created first to verify the integration of these features.

*   **Integration Areas:**
    1. **WSDE Model and Memory System Integration:**
       * ✓ Create BDD tests for storing and retrieving WSDE team state, solutions, and dialectical reasoning results in different memory backends
       * ✓ Implement `WSDEMemoryIntegration` class for WSDE teams to interact with the memory system

           * Logger configuration issues ("TypeError: Logger._log() got an unexpected keyword argument 'error'")
           * Data format issues ("TypeError: string indices must be integers, not 'str'")
           * Empty result sets ("assert 0 > 0")
           * Constructor parameter issues ("TypeError: MemoryAdapterError.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument")

       * Create BDD feature files in `tests/behavior/features/` for each integration area
       * Implement step definitions in `tests/behavior/steps/` that verify the expected behavior
       * Write unit tests for each component to verify both happy paths and edge cases
       * Use mocks and stubs to isolate components during testing
       * Use these tests to drive the implementation of the integration
       * Ensure all tests pass before proceeding to the next feature

    2. **Incremental Integration:**
       * Start with simple integrations and gradually add complexity
       * Focus on one integration area at a time, ensuring it works before moving to the next
       * Use the EDRR approach for each integration: Expand (brainstorm integration options), Differentiate (select the best approach), Refine (implement and test), Retrospect (evaluate and improve)
       * Follow the hexagonal architecture pattern:
         * Implement domain models first
         * Create application services that use domain models
         * Develop adapters for external interfaces

    3. **Dialectical Reasoning Application:**
       * For each implementation decision:
         * **Thesis**: Document the initial design proposal with clear requirements
         * **Antithesis**: Critically examine limitations, edge cases, and alternative approaches
         * **Synthesis**: Create a refined implementation that resolves contradictions and incorporates the best elements
       * Apply this process systematically to ensure thorough examination from multiple perspectives
       * Document the reasoning process and decisions made

    4. **Continuous Validation:**
       * Ensure all tests pass after each integration step
       * Run unit tests to verify component behavior
       * Run behavior tests to verify feature acceptance criteria
       * Use the dialectical reasoning process to critique and improve the integration
       * Document any issues or questions that arise during the integration

*   **Feature Knitting Strategy:**
    1. **Integration Points:**
       * **WSDE Model ↔ Memory System**: The `WSDEMemoryIntegration` class serves as the primary integration point. Extend it to support EDRR phase tagging and knowledge graph access.
       * **AST Analysis ↔ EDRR Workflow**: ✓ Created an `AstWorkflowIntegration` class that connects AST analysis results with EDRR phases, storing intermediate results in memory. The implementation includes methods for using AST analysis in the Expand phase (exploring implementation options), Differentiate phase (evaluating code quality), Refine phase (applying transformations), and Retrospect phase (verifying quality).
       * **Prompt Management ↔ Agents**: Implement an `AgentPromptIntegration` class that provides agents with access to the central prompt manager and handles reflection.
       * **Documentation Management ↔ Memory System**: Extend the `DocumentationRepository` to store documentation chunks in the appropriate memory stores (vector, structured, knowledge graph).
       * **All Components ↔ EDRR Framework**: ✓ Created an `EDRRCoordinator` that orchestrates the flow between components according to the EDRR pattern. The implementation includes methods for starting an EDRR cycle, progressing through phases (Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect), and generating a final report. Each phase interacts with the appropriate components (memory system, WSDE team, AST analyzer, prompt manager, documentation manager) to implement the EDRR workflow.

    2. **Shared Services:**
       * **Memory Manager**: Create a unified `MemoryManager` service that all components can access to store and retrieve information.
       * **EDRR Context**: Implement an `EDRRContext` object that tracks the current phase and carries context between components.
       * **Agent Registry**: Create a central registry of agents that components can access to collaborate with specific agents.
       * **Configuration Service**: Implement a unified configuration service that all components can use to access settings.

    3. **Integration Workflow:**
       * **Phase 1**: Implement the shared services and basic integration points
       * **Phase 2**: Connect WSDE model with memory system and implement EDRR phase tagging
       * **Phase 3**: Implement AST transformation utilities and integrate with EDRR workflow
       * **Phase 4**: Connect prompt management with agents and implement structured reflection
       * **Phase 5**: Integrate documentation management with memory system and implement drift detection
       * **Phase 6**: ✓ Implement the `EDRRCoordinator` to orchestrate the flow between all components

## 1.E Testing and Quality Assurance (Updated: 2023-07-15)

### Test-Driven Development and Behavior-Driven Development Approach

DevSynth follows a strict TDD/BDD approach with a testing-first methodology. Tests are written before the implementation code, ensuring that all features are properly specified and verified. This approach is fully integrated with the dialectical reasoning process described in section 1.0.

#### Benefits of the TDD/BDD Approach

1. **Clarify Requirements**: By writing tests first, we ensure that requirements are well-understood before implementation begins
2. **Prevent Regressions**: Comprehensive test coverage helps catch regressions early
3. **Improve Design**: Test-first development naturally leads to more modular, testable code
4. **Facilitate Collaboration**: BDD scenarios serve as a common language between developers, testers, and stakeholders
5. **Support Dialectical Reasoning**: Tests provide a concrete way to evaluate thesis, antithesis, and synthesis
6. **Enable Continuous Validation**: Automated tests ensure that the system continues to meet requirements as it evolves

#### Implementation of TDD/BDD in DevSynth

For each new feature or enhancement:

1. **Write Behavior Tests First**:
   - Create feature files in `tests/behavior/features/`
   - Implement step definitions in `tests/behavior/steps/`
   - Ensure scenarios cover all acceptance criteria

2. **Write Unit Tests**:
   - Create unit tests for each component
   - Ensure tests verify both happy paths and edge cases
   - Use mocks and stubs to isolate components

3. **Implement Features**:
   - Follow the hexagonal architecture pattern
   - Implement domain models first
   - Create application services that use domain models
   - Develop adapters for external interfaces

4. **Ensure Tests Pass**:
   - Run unit tests to verify component behavior
   - Run behavior tests to verify feature acceptance criteria
   - Fix any failing tests before proceeding

### Multi-Level Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Component isolation with dependency injection

   - Configuration is mocked or temporarily located
   - External resources are properly mocked

2. **File System Isolation**
   - All file operations use temporary directories
   - Tests use `tmp_path` or `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`
   - Cleanup of all temporary files and directories is ensured
   - No tests modify the real filesystem

3. **Dependency Injection**
   - Components accept injectable dependencies
   - Paths and configurations are configurable
   - External services are properly mocked
   - Non-deterministic operations are stubbed

## 1.B Course Correction Plan (Added: YYYY-MM-DD)

Based on a multi-disciplined best-practices approach with dialectical reasoning, the following course correction plan has been developed to enhance DevSynth's architecture, functionality, and alignment with its core principles.

### 1. WSDE Agent Model Refinement

**Current State:** The WSDE (Worker Self-Directed Enterprise) model currently implements a team structure with four roles (Worker, Supervisor, Designer, Evaluator) plus a rotating Primus leader, managed by an `AgentCoordinator`. The current implementation follows a rigid sequence where each agent waits for the previous one to complete its task, and the Primus has the final say.

**Course Correction:**
- **Simplify agent collaboration**: Move from rigid role sequences to a more flexible peer-based structure
- **Implement context-driven leadership**: Make the Primus role truly temporary and based on task expertise
- **Enable autonomous collaboration**: Allow agents to propose solutions or critiques at any stage
- **Reduce hierarchy**: Replace the hard-coded sequence in `AgentCoordinator` with broadcast or consensus-style delegation
- **Implement dialectical review**: Ensure the Critic agent's dialectical process is fully integrated

**Implementation Tasks:**
1. Review agent definitions to ensure Primus role rotates evenly among agents
2. Update orchestration layer to enforce peer collaboration through consensus mechanisms
3. Create or update design diagrams showing the WSDE workflow
4. Write BDD scenarios demonstrating WSDE in action
5. Develop unit tests for Primus rotation and integration tests verifying no agent is permanently dominant

### 2. Memory and Knowledge Architecture Enhancement

**Current State:** DevSynth uses a hybrid storage system with options for in-memory, JSON file, or ChromaDB vector storage, managed by a `MemorySystemAdapter`.

**Course Correction:**
- **Implement a multi-layered memory system**:
  - Short-term (working) memory for immediate context
  - Episodic memory for past events
  - Semantic memory for general knowledge
- **Introduce knowledge graph capabilities** using RDF/quad store
- **Enhance vector storage options** with embedded-first alternatives
- **Implement structured memory** using TinyDB for episodic/working memory

**Implementation Tasks:**
1. Abstract memory interfaces to accept new storage types (DuckDB, FAISS, LMDB)
2. Implement RDF-based knowledge graph using RDFLib or similar
3. Create TinyDB-backed store for structured memory
4. Develop a unified query interface (Memory Manager) with adapters for different storage types
5. Implement a tiered cache strategy with in-memory cache for frequently used items
6. Add configuration options for selecting memory backends
7. Create benchmarks to compare query latency and recall across different backends

### 3. AST-Based Code Analysis and Transformation

**Current State:** DevSynth includes a Python `CodeAnalyzer` that uses the built-in `ast` module to parse files and extract structure.

**Course Correction:**
- **Extend code analysis capabilities**: Build on existing `CodeAnalyzer` to populate memory with rich code representations
- **Implement AST transformations**: Provide utilities for structured code edits using AST modifications
- **Add CLI commands for AST tooling**: Allow users and agents to invoke analysis and transformations
- **Integrate with BDD/TDD workflows**: Use AST analysis to drive test generation and quality metrics

**Implementation Tasks:**
1. Design a new module for AST-based code manipulation
2. Update the Code Agent to accept AST edits
3. Implement utilities for common tasks (extracting function definitions, merging diffs, renaming identifiers)
4. Add BDD scenarios for code structure critique using AST queries
5. Update architecture diagrams to show code output passing through AST validation/refinement

### 4. EDRR as Core Workflow Framework

**Current State:** EDRR (Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect) is currently applied in ingestion but not consistently across all workflows.

**Course Correction:**
- **Extend EDRR to all workflows**: Apply EDRR principles to planning, specification, coding, and other stages
- **Tag memory items with EDRR phases**: Enable querying by workflow stage
- **Structure agent deliberation as EDRR cycles**: Implement agent behavior following the EDRR pattern
- **Use EDRR for project analysis**: Scope analysis tasks according to EDRR phases

**Implementation Tasks:**
1. Define EDRR steps for each context in documentation
2. Implement EDRR agents/handlers for each major workflow
3. Write BDD scenarios that exercise the full EDRR cycle
4. Extend logging to record EDRR metrics
5. Update CLI to include sub-commands or flags corresponding to each EDRR stage
6. Tag WSDE items with EDRR phase metadata

### 5. DPSy-AI for Prompt Management and Reflection

**Current State:** DevSynth references "DSPy" (dynamic prompt templates optimization) but lacks a comprehensive prompt management system.

**Course Correction:**
- **Implement prompt templates & versioning**: Maintain a library of prompt templates for each agent/task
- **Add structured reflection**: Automatically trigger reflection steps after each prompt/response
- **Enable dynamic tuning**: Use prompt variants and compare results
- **Enhance explainability**: Require agents to output rationales along with answers

**Implementation Tasks:**
1. Develop a prompt manager module to define and store prompt templates
2. Implement a feedback loop for prompt efficacy review
3. Configure prompt storage in memory/DB for reuse
4. Write BDD tests for prompt variations
5. Create documentation on prompt engineering and the DPSy-AI system

### 6. Logging, Benchmarking, and Evaluation Framework

**Current State:** DevSynth uses structured logging with JSON formatting and traceability via `DevSynthLogger`.

**Course Correction:**
- **Enhance logging coverage**: Add log statements at key operations
- **Implement benchmarking suite**: Measure performance and resource usage for critical tasks
- **Define model evaluation metrics**: Establish success metrics for code correctness, test pass rate, etc.
- **Create test infrastructure**: Write tests to assert that models produce expected behavior

**Implementation Tasks:**
1. Audit code modules to add log statements at key operations
2. Add performance tests for critical tasks
3. Define success metrics and create example-driven evaluation
4. Write unit/integration tests for expected model behavior
5. Update deployment scripts to include new dependencies
6. Add a "Monitoring and Evaluation" section to documentation

### 7. Version-Aware Documentation Management

**Current State:** DevSynth handles documentation but lacks version-specific awareness for libraries and frameworks.

**Course Correction:**
- **Implement version-aware documentation retrieval**: Maintain a manifest of project dependencies and use it to drive doc retrieval
- **Support offline and lazy-loaded modes**: Pre-fetch docs for offline use or pull documentation on demand
- **Index documentation with metadata**: Tag each chunk with library name, version, section, and source URL
- **Implement drift detection**: Monitor for version changes and trigger re-indexing when needed

**Implementation Tasks:**
1. Create a documentation ingestion pipeline
2. Implement version tagging for documentation chunks
3. Develop a query engine for retrieving version-specific documentation
4. Add monitoring for documentation drift
5. Implement periodic maintenance jobs for updating the documentation corpus

## 2. Implementation Priorities

---

## 3. Current State Snapshot
1. **Documentation**: Extensive but fragmented across `docs/`, `post_mvp_plan/`, `roadmap/`, `specification/`, `technical_reference/`, `user_guides/`. Some overlap and outdated content.
2. **Tests**: Gherkin feature tests (`behavior/`), integration, unit tests present; inconsistent coverage and missing edge‐case scenarios.
3. **Codebase**: Python package with CLI and modular adapters, agents, ports; some modules lacking docstrings and type hints.
4. **DevSynth Ingestion**: No centralized manifest; converters (`convert_docstrings.py`, `gen_ref_pages.py`) exist but require standardization.

---

## 4. Gaps & Ambiguities
- **Redundant docs**: Multiple spec versions (`devsynth_specification*.md`), outdated roadmaps.
- **Testing gaps**: Missing tests for failure paths, memory and caching behavior, performance limits.
- **Code hygiene**: Inconsistent logging, lack of uniform error classes, missing static typing in key modules.
- **Ingestion readiness**: No single index or metadata file for DevSynth to parse; doc headers are not standardized.
- **Test isolation**: Tests that modify real filesystem, reliance on global state, and non-hermetic test dependencies that can lead to flaky tests and side effects.

---

## 5. Next-Steps Action Plan
### 5.0 Current-Phase Assessment
- Assign a phase lead responsible for tracking progress, risks, and cross-functional dependencies. **Action:** Project Leadership to assign immediately.

### 5.1 Documentation Harmonization  (Owner: Documentation Lead; Timeline: 2 sprints)
- Consolidate specification into a single `SPECIFICATION.md` at root; merge MVP and non-MVP content.
- Deprecate or archive outdated docs in `docs/archived` and `specifications/archived`. Review internal links post-consolidation.
- ✓ Introduce front-matter metadata in all `.md` (title, date, version, tags). Key documentation files have been updated with front-matter metadata.
- Update `mkdocs.yml` to reflect consolidated structure (including new `SPECIFICATION.md` and `DEVONBOARDING.md`) and generate search index.
- Draft an adoption guide: `DEVONBOARDING.md` for new contributors.
- ✓ Define and publish front-matter schema (title, date, version, tags) with a template file `docs/metadata_template.md`.
  - ✓ Ensure `docs/metadata_template.md` not only contains valid example front-matter but also provides brief explanations for each field, its expected format, and allowed values where applicable.
- ✓ Create `scripts/validate_metadata.py` to enforce front-matter schema; integrate into CI.
- ✓ Add automated CI step to scan all Markdown files for metadata validation; fail build on missing or malformed front-matter. GitHub Actions workflow created in `.github/workflows/validate_metadata.yml`.
- Acceptance Criteria: All markdown files pass metadata validation; CI pipeline fails on violations; `mkdocs.yml` reflects new structure; internal document links are correct.

### 5.2 Testing & Quality Barrier  (Owner: QA Lead; Timeline: 3 sprints) ✓
- **Hermetic Testing Standards:** ✓
  - Create `docs/developer_guides/hermetic_testing.md` documenting guidelines for creating isolated, side-effect-free tests. ✓
  - Enforce the use of temporary directories for all filesystem operations in tests using pytest's `tmp_path` fixture or `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`. ✓
  - Extend `tests/conftest.py` with shared fixtures for environment isolation, including: ✓
    - A global `test_environment` fixture with `autouse=True` that isolates the entire test environment. ✓
    - Fixtures for common setup/cleanup (temp project root, temp log dir). ✓
  - Implement a `reset_global_state` fixture to reset module-level globals between tests. ✓
  - Audit all existing tests and flag any that modify real filesystem or rely on global state. ✓

- **Environment Isolation:** ✓
  - Enforce the pattern established in `tests/behavior/conftest.py` where `patch_env_and_cleanup` saves and restores environment variables. ✓
  - Create a standardized fixture to redirect filesystem paths (e.g., log directories, config paths) to temporary locations. ✓
  - Ensure all tests that require configuration use mocked or temporarily-located configurations. ✓
  - Use markers for tests requiring external resources (`@pytest.mark.requires_resource`) and ensure proper mocking alternatives. ✓

- **Test Coverage & Validation:**
  - Achieve 90%+ unit-test coverage across domain and application modules. Focus on:
    - Exception and fallback logic (`fallback.py`, `exceptions.py`).
    - Config parsing and edge cases (`config/`).
  - Expand BDD feature scenarios to include:
    - Core user workflows and happy path scenarios.
    - Memory leaks and state reset between runs.
    - API rate-limiting and throttling.
  - Integrate coverage report in CI pipeline and enforce threshold.
  - Automate test data generation with fixtures in `tests/fixtures`. Review and update existing test data and fixtures for relevance and completeness.
  - Add pytest fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` for common data patterns; include memory-reset fixture.
  - Implement coverage reporting with `pytest-cov`; fail CI if coverage <90%.
  - Write performance smoke tests to detect memory leaks and throttling behavior.
  - Introduce smoke/performance tests using pytest-benchmark or similar.
  - Add failure-mode tests (e.g., simulated service outages, malformed inputs).
  - Investigate and implement linting/formatting for Gherkin `.feature` files (e.g., using `gherkin-lint`).

- **Test Data & External Dependencies:**
  - Implement standardized mocking for external services (e.g., LLM providers) to prevent network calls in tests.
  - Use `pytest-mock` to stub non-deterministic operations (random numbers, timestamps) for reproducible tests.
  - Add fixtures to create isolated test data that doesn't depend on state from previous tests.
  - Implement property-based testing (using Hypothesis) for core utilities like token counting and context management.

- **CI Integration:**
  - Configure CI to run tests in a clean, isolated environment (Docker or containerized runners).
  - Ensure no shared resources or state persists between CI runs.
  - Add test isolation validation checks to CI pipeline.

- **Acceptance Criteria:** 
  - Coverage badge added to README; CI enforces coverage threshold; Gherkin files are linted.
  - All tests run successfully in isolation without side effects.
  - CI pipeline fails if tests attempt to modify real filesystem or environment outside of temporary locations.
  - Test isolation guidelines are documented and enforced.

### 5.3 Code Hygiene & Architecture Enforcement  (Owner: Architecture Lead; Timeline: 2 sprints)
- **Dependency Injection & Testability:**
  - Refactor modules to accept injectable dependencies rather than relying on globals or direct filesystem access.
  - Modify `settings.py` to support configuration overriding for tests.
  - Refactor key components that perform I/O (filesystem, network) to use interfaces that can be easily mocked in tests.
  - Create adapter interfaces for all external dependencies following the hexagonal architecture pattern.

- **Refactor Stateful Components:**
  - Refactor `logging_setup.py` to:
    - Avoid creating directories on import.
    - Make the log directory configurable via environment or parameters.
    - Provide a configurable singleton logger instance.
    - Ensure all log file creation is deferred until explicitly required.
  - Update the `Settings` class to:
    - Allow injection of alternative paths for tests.
    - Defer file path resolution until needed.
    - Support overriding default paths like `memory_file_path`.

- **Enforce Static Typing:**
  - Configure `mypy` in `pyproject.toml` with appropriate strictness.
  - Integrate `mypy` checks into the CI pipeline; fail build on type errors.
  - Incrementally add type hints to existing critical modules, prioritizing `src/devsynth/domain/` and `src/devsynth/application/`.

- **Standardize Logging:**
  - Ensure all modules throughout the codebase utilize the central logger.
  - Define clear logging levels and conventions (e.g., when to use INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR).

- **Refine Error Hierarchy:** ✓
  - Ensure all custom exceptions inherit from a base `DevSynthError` defined in `src/devsynth/exceptions.py`. ✓
  - Add comprehensive docstrings and type annotations to all custom exception classes. ✓
  - Review and refactor existing error handling to use the standardized hierarchy. ✓

- **Audit Adapters and Providers:**
  - Enforce consistent method signatures, return types, and comprehensive docstrings for all adapters and providers.
  - Verify adherence to defined interface contracts.

- **Strengthen Hexagonal Architecture Enforcement:**
  - Clearly define port interfaces in `src/devsynth/ports/`.
  - Ensure adapters in `src/devsynth/adapters/` strictly implement these ports and contain no business logic.
  - Review existing modules and refactor to align with port/adapter separation.
  - Conduct a workshop with the development team to ensure shared understanding and consistent application of hexagonal architecture principles.

- **Configure and Enforce Linters and Formatters:**
  - Add `pylint` and `flake8` configurations to `pyproject.toml` (or dedicated config files).
  - Integrate `pylint`, `flake8`, and a code formatter (e.g., `black` or `ruff format`) into the CI pipeline.
  - Document code style guidelines in `docs/developer_guides/code_style.md`.

- **Establish Semantic Versioning Policy:**
  - Document semantic versioning policy in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  - Automate version bumping as part of the release process if feasible (e.g., using `poetry version`).

- **SOLID Principles Review:**
  - Review and refactor complex or critical modules for clarity, maintainability, and adherence to SOLID principles.
  - Ensure separation of concerns, particularly between business logic and I/O operations.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - CI pipeline successfully runs `mypy`, `pylint`, `flake8`, and code formatting checks without errors on new/modified code.
  - All custom exceptions inherit from `DevSynthError`.
  - Logging is standardized through the central logger with configurable paths.
  - Key modules demonstrate improved type hint coverage and docstring quality.
  - Semantic versioning policy is documented and understood.
  - Components that perform I/O accept injectable paths or configuration.

    - Define the public interface in `src/devsynth/application/promises/interface.py`. ✓
    - Implement a prototype in `src/devsynth/application/promises/`, including core logic for promise creation, resolution, rejection, and chaining. ✓
    - Write comprehensive unit tests for all aspects of the promise system, including edge cases and error handling. ✓
    - Develop a clear strategy for how DevSynth will visualize and trace promise chains, their states, and associated data during analysis. This strategy should influence the metadata, events, or logging exposed by the Promise System. ✓
    - Consider how DevSynth will analyze and represent promise-based asynchronous flows. ✓
- **Agent Orchestration Enhancement:**
    - Define agent lifecycle hooks (e.g., `on_start`, `on_message`, `on_error`, `on_stop`) and event emission mechanisms.
    - Document these in `docs/architecture/agent_system.md`, including sequence diagrams for typical orchestration flows.
    - Implement changes in `src/devsynth/application/agents/` and `src/devsynth/application/orchestration/`.

    - Agent orchestration lifecycle hooks and event emissions are implemented and documented.
    - Dialectical reasoning flow is clearly documented with updated diagrams.
    - DevSynth ingestion capabilities are considered during the design of these systems.

### 5.5 DevSynth Ingestion, Adaptation & Indexing  (Owner: Tooling Lead; Timeline: 1 sprint, then ongoing refinement)
- **Manifest File:**
    - Create `manifest.yaml` at the root of the project. **(DONE - Initial version created and populated)**
    - Define a clear schema for `manifest.yaml` in `docs/manifest_schema.json` (using JSON Schema syntax). This schema should detail how to list documents, code modules (Python files/packages), test files (unit, integration, BDD features), and their associated metadata (e.g., purpose, dependencies, version, last_modified, owner for code; covered features/modules for tests; tags, status for docs). **(DONE - Schema created and updated for project structure)**
    - **Crucially, the schema must also accommodate definitions for diverse project structures**: e.g., monorepo type, locations of sub-projects or modules, language mix, custom directory layouts, and other structural metadata. This allows users to configure how DevSynth interprets their specific project arrangement. **(DONE - Schema updated with `projectStructure` block)**
    - Populate `manifest.yaml` with initial entries for all key project artifacts, including structural definitions where applicable. **(DONE - `manifest.yaml` populated with `projectStructure` and example artifacts)**
    - Create `scripts/validate_manifest.py` to validate `manifest.yaml` against `manifest_schema.json`; integrate this script into the CI pipeline. **(DONE - Script created and implemented with schema, structural, and path validation. Integrated into local CI simulation via `Taskfile.yml`. Full CI pipeline integration (e.g., GitHub Actions) pending.)**
    - Enhance the `init_cmd` function to automatically create a manifest.yaml file when initializing a project with `devsynth init`. **(DONE - Implemented in `src/devsynth/application/cli/cli_commands.py`)**
    - Implement an `analyze-manifest` command to analyze, update, refine, and prune the manifest.yaml file based on the actual project structure. **(DONE - Implemented in `src/devsynth/application/cli/commands/analyze_manifest_cmd.py`)**
- **Ingestion Scripting & Adaptation Process:**
    - Review and consolidate `convert_docstrings_v2.py` and `gen_ref_pages.py`. Aim for a single, robust script or a clearly defined pipeline for processing.
    - Update the chosen script(s) to consume `manifest.yaml` as the source of truth, including the project structure definitions.
    - **Implement a dialectical three-phase process for initial ingestion and subsequent adaptation to codebase changes (e.g., from `git pull` or manual edits):**
        1.  **Expand (Bottom-Up Integration):** DevSynth will first analyze the project from the ground up (code, tests, existing artifacts). This phase focuses on building a comprehensive understanding of the current state, ensuring that all features, functionalities, and behaviors, even those only defined at lower levels, are captured without loss.
        2.  **Differentiate (Top-Down Validation):** Using the understanding from the "Expand" phase, DevSynth will then validate this state against higher-level definitions (requirements, specifications, architectural documents, diagrams) in a top-down, recursive manner. This phase identifies consistencies, discrepancies, new elements, and outdated components.
        3.  **Refine (Hygiene, Resilience, and Integration):** Based on the "Differentiate" phase, DevSynth will facilitate the removal or archiving of old, unneeded, or deprecated parts. It will also verify that all critical tests (behavioral, integration, unit) pass, aiming for 100% coverage on essential components, and ensure overall project hygiene is maintained or improved.
    - Ensure the script extracts relevant information:
        - From Markdown: front-matter metadata, section structure, links.
        - From Python code: module/class/function docstrings, signatures, dependencies (imports), and cross-references.
        - From `.feature` files: scenarios, steps, and tags.
        - From project structure: utilizing the manifest's structural definitions to correctly navigate and interpret diverse layouts.
    - The output for DevSynth analysis should be a well-defined, versioned, structured JSON format. This output format's schema (e.g., JSON Schema compliant, potentially with OpenAPI-style descriptions for code APIs and clearly defined link types for semantic relationships) must be documented, versioned, and maintained alongside the ingestion scripts.

- **Multi-Disciplinary Dialectical Reasoning Enhancement:** How can we further enhance the multi-disciplinary dialectical reasoning to handle a wider range of disciplines and perspectives? Should we implement a more formal framework for identifying and resolving conflicts between different disciplinary perspectives?
- **Integration with EDRR Workflow:** How should we integrate the multi-disciplinary dialectical reasoning approach with the EDRR workflow to ensure consistent application of both methodologies?
- **Metrics for Dialectical Reasoning Effectiveness:** What metrics should we use to measure the effectiveness of the dialectical reasoning process? How can we quantify the improvement in solution quality resulting from the application of multi-disciplinary dialectical reasoning?
- **Cross-Functional Review Process:** How should we implement the cross-functional review process for major design decisions? What tools and processes would best support this approach?
- **Knowledge Integration:** How can we better integrate external knowledge sources into the dialectical reasoning process? Should we implement a more sophisticated knowledge retrieval mechanism to provide relevant information from different disciplines?

#### Multi-Disciplined Best-Practices Implementation
Following the insights from the scratch files, we should continue to apply the multi-disciplined best-practices approach with dialectical reasoning to all aspects of the project:

1. **Dialectical Framework for Implementation:**
   - Apply the Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis methodology to all feature implementations
   - Document the reasoning process for major design decisions
   - Ensure thorough examination of all design decisions from multiple perspectives
   - For each feature implementation:
     - **Thesis Phase**: Document initial design proposal with clear requirements, create implementation plan, identify key components and interfaces, develop preliminary test cases
     - **Antithesis Phase**: Critically examine limitations, identify edge cases and failure modes, consider alternative approaches, evaluate trade-offs, challenge assumptions
     - **Synthesis Phase**: Develop refined implementation that resolves contradictions, incorporate best elements from different approaches, address all identified edge cases, create comprehensive test suite, document reasoning process

2. **TDD/BDD Methodology:**
   - Continue to write behavior tests first for all new features
   - Implement unit tests for all components before implementation
   - Ensure tests verify both happy paths and edge cases
   - Follow the hexagonal architecture pattern in all implementations
   - For each new feature or enhancement:
     - Write behavior tests first to define acceptance criteria
     - Write unit tests to verify component behavior
     - Implement features following the hexagonal architecture pattern
     - Ensure all tests pass before proceeding

3. **Cross-Cutting Concerns:**
   - Implement consistent error handling across all components
   - Ensure proper observability with structured logging
   - Maintain configuration management with validation

   - Implement service interfaces for external dependencies
   - Define ports for adapters to implement
   - Implement concrete adapters for various technologies
   - Create CLI commands that map to application use cases
   - Develop storage adapters for different backends

5. **Multi-Disciplinary Approach:**
   - Synthesize best practices from multiple disciplines:
     - Software engineering (hexagonal architecture, TDD/BDD)
     - Artificial intelligence (agent systems, prompt engineering)
     - Knowledge management (semantic networks, vector embeddings)
     - Cognitive science (memory models, dialectical reasoning)
     - Systems thinking (integration, emergent properties)
   - Apply dialectical reasoning to identify and resolve conflicts between different disciplinary perspectives
