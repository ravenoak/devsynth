# DevSynth Next-Steps & Cleanup Plan

**Date:** May 25, 2025
**Author:** GitHub Copilot

## 1. Overview
This document synthesizes a dialectical, multi-discipline review of the entire DevSynth workspace—code, docs, tests, features—and outlines a clear, actionable roadmap for the next phase: "Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect". This updated plan serves as a living document to align all stakeholders, eliminate ambiguity, and ensure DevSynth itself can fully ingest and analyze this project.

## 2. Current State Snapshot
1. **Documentation**: Extensive but fragmented across `docs/`, `post_mvp_plan/`, `roadmap/`, `specification/`, `technical_reference/`, `user_guides/`. Some overlap and outdated content.
2. **Tests**: Gherkin feature tests (`behavior/`), integration, unit tests present; inconsistent coverage and missing edge‐case scenarios.
3. **Codebase**: Python package with CLI and modular adapters, agents, ports; some modules lacking docstrings and type hints.
4. **DevSynth Ingestion**: No centralized manifest; converters (`convert_docstrings.py`, `gen_ref_pages.py`) exist but require standardization.

---

## 3. Gaps & Ambiguities
- **Redundant docs**: Multiple spec versions (`devsynth_specification*.md`), outdated roadmaps.
- **Testing gaps**: Missing tests for failure paths, memory and caching behavior, performance limits.
- **Code hygiene**: Inconsistent logging, lack of uniform error classes, missing static typing in key modules.
- **Ingestion readiness**: No single index or metadata file for DevSynth to parse; doc headers are not standardized.
- **Test isolation**: Tests that modify real filesystem, reliance on global state, and non-hermetic test dependencies that can lead to flaky tests and side effects.

---

## 4. Next-Steps Action Plan
### 4.0 Current-Phase Assessment
- Assign a phase lead responsible for tracking progress, risks, and cross-functional dependencies. **Action:** Project Leadership to assign immediately.

### 4.1 Documentation Harmonization  (Owner: Documentation Lead; Timeline: 2 sprints)
- Consolidate specification into a single `SPECIFICATION.md` at root; merge MVP and non-MVP content.
- Deprecate or archive outdated docs in `docs/archived` and `specifications/archived`. Review internal links post-consolidation.
- ✓ Introduce front-matter metadata in all `.md` (title, date, version, tags). Key documentation files have been updated with front-matter metadata.
- Update `mkdocs.yml` to reflect consolidated structure (including new `SPECIFICATION.md` and `DEVONBOARDING.md`) and generate search index.
- Draft an adoption guide: `DEVONBOARDING.md` for new contributors.
- ✓ Define and publish front-matter schema (title, date, version, tags) with a template file `docs/metadata_template.md`.
  - ✓ Ensure `docs/metadata_template.md` not only contains valid example front-matter but also provides brief explanations for each field, its expected format, and allowed values where applicable.
- ✓ Create `scripts/validate_metadata.py` to enforce front-matter schema; integrate into CI.
- ✓ Add automated CI step to scan all Markdown files for metadata validation; fail build on missing or malformed front-matter. GitHub Actions workflow created in `.github/workflows/validate_metadata.yml`.
- Acceptance Criteria: All markdown files pass metadata validation; CI pipeline fails on violations; `mkdocs.yml` reflects new structure; internal document links are correct.

### 4.2 Testing & Quality Barrier  (Owner: QA Lead; Timeline: 3 sprints) ✓
- **Hermetic Testing Standards:** ✓
  - Create `docs/developer_guides/hermetic_testing.md` documenting guidelines for creating isolated, side-effect-free tests. ✓
  - Enforce the use of temporary directories for all filesystem operations in tests using pytest's `tmp_path` fixture or `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`. ✓
  - Extend `tests/conftest.py` with shared fixtures for environment isolation, including: ✓
    - A global `test_environment` fixture with `autouse=True` that isolates the entire test environment. ✓
    - Fixtures for common setup/cleanup (temp project root, temp log dir). ✓
  - Implement a `reset_global_state` fixture to reset module-level globals between tests. ✓
  - Audit all existing tests and flag any that modify real filesystem or rely on global state. ✓

- **Environment Isolation:** ✓
  - Enforce the pattern established in `tests/behavior/conftest.py` where `patch_env_and_cleanup` saves and restores environment variables. ✓
  - Create a standardized fixture to redirect filesystem paths (e.g., log directories, config paths) to temporary locations. ✓
  - Ensure all tests that require configuration use mocked or temporarily-located configurations. ✓
  - Use markers for tests requiring external resources (`@pytest.mark.requires_resource`) and ensure proper mocking alternatives. ✓

- **Test Coverage & Validation:**
  - Achieve 90%+ unit-test coverage across domain and application modules. Focus on:
    - Exception and fallback logic (`fallback.py`, `exceptions.py`).
    - Config parsing and edge cases (`config/`).
  - Expand BDD feature scenarios to include:
    - Core user workflows and happy path scenarios.
    - Memory leaks and state reset between runs.
    - API rate-limiting and throttling.
  - Integrate coverage report in CI pipeline and enforce threshold.
  - Automate test data generation with fixtures in `tests/fixtures`. Review and update existing test data and fixtures for relevance and completeness.
  - Add pytest fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` for common data patterns; include memory-reset fixture.
  - Implement coverage reporting with `pytest-cov`; fail CI if coverage <90%.
  - Write performance smoke tests to detect memory leaks and throttling behavior.
  - Introduce smoke/performance tests using pytest-benchmark or similar.
  - Add failure-mode tests (e.g., simulated service outages, malformed inputs).
  - Investigate and implement linting/formatting for Gherkin `.feature` files (e.g., using `gherkin-lint`).

- **Test Data & External Dependencies:**
  - Implement standardized mocking for external services (e.g., LLM providers) to prevent network calls in tests.
  - Use `pytest-mock` to stub non-deterministic operations (random numbers, timestamps) for reproducible tests.
  - Add fixtures to create isolated test data that doesn't depend on state from previous tests.
  - Implement property-based testing (using Hypothesis) for core utilities like token counting and context management.

- **CI Integration:**
  - Configure CI to run tests in a clean, isolated environment (Docker or containerized runners).
  - Ensure no shared resources or state persists between CI runs.
  - Add test isolation validation checks to CI pipeline.

- **Acceptance Criteria:** 
  - Coverage badge added to README; CI enforces coverage threshold; Gherkin files are linted.
  - All tests run successfully in isolation without side effects.
  - CI pipeline fails if tests attempt to modify real filesystem or environment outside of temporary locations.
  - Test isolation guidelines are documented and enforced.

### 4.3 Code Hygiene & Architecture Enforcement  (Owner: Architecture Lead; Timeline: 2 sprints)
- **Dependency Injection & Testability:**
  - Refactor modules to accept injectable dependencies rather than relying on globals or direct filesystem access.
  - Modify `settings.py` to support configuration overriding for tests.
  - Refactor key components that perform I/O (filesystem, network) to use interfaces that can be easily mocked in tests.
  - Create adapter interfaces for all external dependencies following the hexagonal architecture pattern.

- **Refactor Stateful Components:**
  - Refactor `logging_setup.py` to:
    - Avoid creating directories on import.
    - Make the log directory configurable via environment or parameters.
    - Provide a configurable singleton logger instance.
    - Ensure all log file creation is deferred until explicitly required.
  - Update the `Settings` class to:
    - Allow injection of alternative paths for tests.
    - Defer file path resolution until needed.
    - Support overriding default paths like `memory_file_path`.

- **Enforce Static Typing:**
  - Configure `mypy` in `pyproject.toml` with appropriate strictness.
  - Integrate `mypy` checks into the CI pipeline; fail build on type errors.
  - Incrementally add type hints to existing critical modules, prioritizing `src/devsynth/domain/` and `src/devsynth/application/`.

- **Standardize Logging:**
  - Ensure all modules throughout the codebase utilize the central logger.
  - Define clear logging levels and conventions (e.g., when to use INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR).

- **Refine Error Hierarchy:** ✓
  - Ensure all custom exceptions inherit from a base `DevSynthError` defined in `src/devsynth/exceptions.py`. ✓
  - Add comprehensive docstrings and type annotations to all custom exception classes. ✓
  - Review and refactor existing error handling to use the standardized hierarchy. ✓

- **Audit Adapters and Providers:**
  - Enforce consistent method signatures, return types, and comprehensive docstrings for all adapters and providers.
  - Verify adherence to defined interface contracts.

- **Strengthen Hexagonal Architecture Enforcement:**
  - Clearly define port interfaces in `src/devsynth/ports/`.
  - Ensure adapters in `src/devsynth/adapters/` strictly implement these ports and contain no business logic.
  - Review existing modules and refactor to align with port/adapter separation.
  - Conduct a workshop with the development team to ensure shared understanding and consistent application of hexagonal architecture principles.

- **Configure and Enforce Linters and Formatters:**
  - Add `pylint` and `flake8` configurations to `pyproject.toml` (or dedicated config files).
  - Integrate `pylint`, `flake8`, and a code formatter (e.g., `black` or `ruff format`) into the CI pipeline.
  - Document code style guidelines in `docs/developer_guides/code_style.md`.

- **Establish Semantic Versioning Policy:**
  - Document semantic versioning policy in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  - Automate version bumping as part of the release process if feasible (e.g., using `poetry version`).

- **SOLID Principles Review:**
  - Review and refactor complex or critical modules for clarity, maintainability, and adherence to SOLID principles.
  - Ensure separation of concerns, particularly between business logic and I/O operations.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - CI pipeline successfully runs `mypy`, `pylint`, `flake8`, and code formatting checks without errors on new/modified code.
  - All custom exceptions inherit from `DevSynthError`.
  - Logging is standardized through the central logger with configurable paths.
  - Key modules demonstrate improved type hint coverage and docstring quality.
  - Semantic versioning policy is documented and understood.
  - Components that perform I/O accept injectable paths or configuration.

### 4.4 Feature Roadmap & Incremental Delivery  (Owner: Product Lead; Timeline: ongoing)
- **Promise System Development:** ✓
    - Create directory structure: `src/devsynth/application/promises/`. ✓
    - Draft API specification in `docs/promise_system_scope.md`, detailing states, transitions, and error handling. ✓
    - Define the public interface in `src/devsynth/application/promises/interface.py`. ✓
    - Implement a prototype in `src/devsynth/application/promises/`, including core logic for promise creation, resolution, rejection, and chaining. ✓
    - Write comprehensive unit tests for all aspects of the promise system, including edge cases and error handling. ✓
    - Develop a clear strategy for how DevSynth will visualize and trace promise chains, their states, and associated data during analysis. This strategy should influence the metadata, events, or logging exposed by the Promise System. ✓
    - Consider how DevSynth will analyze and represent promise-based asynchronous flows. ✓
- **Agent Orchestration Enhancement:**
    - Define agent lifecycle hooks (e.g., `on_start`, `on_message`, `on_error`, `on_stop`) and event emission mechanisms.
    - Document these in `docs/architecture/agent_system.md`, including sequence diagrams for typical orchestration flows.
    - Implement changes in `src/devsynth/application/agents/` and `src/devsynth/application/orchestration/`.
- **Dialectical Reasoning Flow Clarification:**
    - Update `docs/architecture/dialectical_reasoning.md` with detailed sequence diagrams (stored in `docs/diagrams/`) illustrating the interaction of components during reasoning.
    - Ensure the documentation clearly explains the inputs, processing steps, and outputs of the dialectical reasoning module.
    - Ensure the updated documentation and diagrams explicitly detail how DevSynth can trace a dialectical reasoning process, including inputs, intermediate states/arguments, decision points, and final synthesis, to facilitate its analytical capabilities.
- General:
    - Break down all new features and significant enhancements into incremental user stories with clear acceptance criteria and assign them to sprints.
    - Create proof-of-concept implementations or usage examples for new core features to validate design and usability.
- Success Metrics:
    - Promise system prototype is functional, passes all unit tests, and its API is clearly documented.
    - Agent orchestration lifecycle hooks and event emissions are implemented and documented.
    - Dialectical reasoning flow is clearly documented with updated diagrams.
    - DevSynth ingestion capabilities are considered during the design of these systems.

### 4.5 DevSynth Ingestion, Adaptation & Indexing  (Owner: Tooling Lead; Timeline: 1 sprint, then ongoing refinement)
- **Manifest File:**
    - Create `manifest.yaml` at the root of the project. **(DONE - Initial version created and populated)**
    - Define a clear schema for `manifest.yaml` in `docs/manifest_schema.json` (using JSON Schema syntax). This schema should detail how to list documents, code modules (Python files/packages), test files (unit, integration, BDD features), and their associated metadata (e.g., purpose, dependencies, version, last_modified, owner for code; covered features/modules for tests; tags, status for docs). **(DONE - Schema created and updated for project structure)**
    - **Crucially, the schema must also accommodate definitions for diverse project structures**: e.g., monorepo type, locations of sub-projects or modules, language mix, custom directory layouts, and other structural metadata. This allows users to configure how DevSynth interprets their specific project arrangement. **(DONE - Schema updated with `projectStructure` block)**
    - Populate `manifest.yaml` with initial entries for all key project artifacts, including structural definitions where applicable. **(DONE - `manifest.yaml` populated with `projectStructure` and example artifacts)**
    - Create `scripts/validate_manifest.py` to validate `manifest.yaml` against `manifest_schema.json`; integrate this script into the CI pipeline. **(DONE - Script created and implemented with schema, structural, and path validation. Integrated into local CI simulation via `Taskfile.yml`. Full CI pipeline integration (e.g., GitHub Actions) pending.)**
    - Enhance the `init_cmd` function to automatically create a manifest.yaml file when initializing a project with `devsynth init`. **(DONE - Implemented in `src/devsynth/application/cli/cli_commands.py`)**
    - Implement an `analyze-manifest` command to analyze, update, refine, and prune the manifest.yaml file based on the actual project structure. **(DONE - Implemented in `src/devsynth/application/cli/commands/analyze_manifest_cmd.py`)**
- **Ingestion Scripting & Adaptation Process:**
    - Review and consolidate `convert_docstrings_v2.py` and `gen_ref_pages.py`. Aim for a single, robust script or a clearly defined pipeline for processing.
    - Update the chosen script(s) to consume `manifest.yaml` as the source of truth, including the project structure definitions.
    - **Implement a dialectical three-phase process for initial ingestion and subsequent adaptation to codebase changes (e.g., from `git pull` or manual edits):**
        1.  **Expand (Bottom-Up Integration):** DevSynth will first analyze the project from the ground up (code, tests, existing artifacts). This phase focuses on building a comprehensive understanding of the current state, ensuring that all features, functionalities, and behaviors, even those only defined at lower levels, are captured without loss.
        2.  **Differentiate (Top-Down Validation):** Using the understanding from the "Expand" phase, DevSynth will then validate this state against higher-level definitions (requirements, specifications, architectural documents, diagrams) in a top-down, recursive manner. This phase identifies consistencies, discrepancies, new elements, and outdated components.
        3.  **Refine (Hygiene, Resilience, and Integration):** Based on the "Differentiate" phase, DevSynth will facilitate the removal or archiving of old, unneeded, or deprecated parts. It will also verify that all critical tests (behavioral, integration, unit) pass, aiming for 100% coverage on essential components, and ensure overall project hygiene is maintained or improved.
    - Ensure the script extracts relevant information:
        - From Markdown: front-matter metadata, section structure, links.
        - From Python code: module/class/function docstrings, signatures, dependencies (imports), and cross-references.
        - From `.feature` files: scenarios, steps, and tags.
        - From project structure: utilizing the manifest's structural definitions to correctly navigate and interpret diverse layouts.
    - The output for DevSynth analysis should be a well-defined, versioned, structured JSON format. This output format's schema (e.g., JSON Schema compliant, potentially with OpenAPI-style descriptions for code APIs and clearly defined link types for semantic relationships) must be documented, versioned, and maintained alongside the ingestion scripts. This output should capture semantic relationships between artifacts (e.g., a test covers which requirement/code module, a document describes which feature) and reflect the project's defined structure.
- **CLI Command:** **(DONE - Implemented the ingest command with all required features)**
    - Enhance the `devsynth ingest` CLI command in `src/devsynth/cli.py`: **(DONE - Implemented in `src/devsynth/adapters/cli/typer_adapter.py` and `src/devsynth/application/cli/ingest_cmd.py`)**
        - It should trigger the full ingestion and adaptation pipeline (Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect), driven by `manifest.yaml` and its project structure definitions. **(DONE - Implemented with all four phases)**
        - Include `--dry-run` and `--verbose` flags. **(DONE - Both flags implemented)**
        - Add a `--validate-only` flag to check manifest and schema without full processing. **(DONE - Flag implemented)**
        - The command should be capable of processing initial project setup and incremental updates. **(DONE - Command handles both scenarios)**
    - Ensure the CLI command provides clear feedback on success or failure, including insights from the Differentiate and Refine phases. **(DONE - Implemented with rich console output for each phase)**
- **DevSynth Capabilities:**
    - Define requirements for DevSynth's own capabilities to parse, analyze, and utilize the generated JSON index, including its understanding of various project layouts (monorepos, heterogeneous codebases, submodules etc.) based on user-provided configurations in `manifest.yaml`.
- Acceptance Criteria:
    - `manifest.yaml` is created and validated against `manifest_schema.json` (including project structure definitions) in CI. **(Partially Met: Manifest created, schema updated, validation script created and integrated into local CI simulation via `Taskfile.yml`. Full CI pipeline integration pending.)**
    - The `devsynth ingest` CLI command successfully processes the manifest using the "Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect" cycle and generates a comprehensive JSON index for various configured project structures. **(Pending)**
    - The system demonstrates adaptation to changes in the codebase, maintaining project health and test coverage for critical components. **(Pending)**

- Adjust timelines and priorities based on the outcomes of the checkpoints and subsequent sprint retrospectives.
- The overarching goal for the "Refine & Expand Core" sub-phase remains to significantly improve project health and deliver foundational elements of the Promise System, preparing for further expansion.
- Additional focus areas now include deployment infrastructure, performance optimization, error handling UX, security implementation, collaboration processes, and TDD/BDD first development approach to address gaps identified in the critical evaluation.
- The multi-disciplined best-practices approach with dialectical reasoning has been applied to evaluate the project and identify these focus areas, ensuring a comprehensive and balanced development plan that considers multiple perspectives and disciplines.
- **TDD/BDD First Development:** All development will follow a strict test-first approach, with:
  - BDD scenarios written for all user-facing features before implementation
  - Unit tests created for all internal components and edge cases before writing code
  - Integration tests defined for component interactions before integration
  - This approach ensures that requirements are clearly understood and testable before implementation begins
  - The TDD/BDD approach is now fully integrated with the EDRR methodology, creating a cohesive development process
- **Multi-Disciplined Integration:** The TDD/BDD first approach will be integrated with the multi-disciplined best-practices methodology to:
  - Apply dialectical reasoning to test design, considering multiple perspectives
  - Ensure tests reflect requirements from all stakeholders and disciplines
  - Create a cross-functional review process for test cases
  - Document how tests address different disciplinary concerns
  - This integration creates a robust, well-tested, and thoroughly documented system
- **Artifact Alignment:** Regular reviews will be conducted to ensure that all project artifacts are aligned, congruent, complementary, and harmonic with each other:
  - Documentation, diagrams, and pseudocode must accurately reflect the implemented code
  - Behavior tests must align with user requirements and documented features
  - Integration tests must verify the interactions described in architectural documents
  - Unit tests must validate the behavior specified in component documentation
  - All artifacts must follow the principles of dialectical reasoning to identify and resolve contradictions
  - A formal artifact alignment review process will be established as part of the regular sprint retrospectives
