# PYTEST CONFIGURATION MIGRATED TO PYPROJECT.TOML
# ===============================================================================
#
# This file has been simplified as part of Task 2.2: Consolidate pytest Configuration.
# All pytest configuration has been moved to [tool.pytest.ini_options] in pyproject.toml
# for centralized configuration management.
#
# The configuration includes:
# - Core settings (testpaths, norecursedirs)
# - Default options (coverage, markers, strict settings)
# - All test markers (resource, speed, type, context, functional, special)
# - Asyncio and BDD configuration
#
# This file is kept minimal for backward compatibility and documentation.
# If you need to modify pytest configuration, edit pyproject.toml instead.
#
# Note on running isolation tests:
# Tests marked with @pytest.mark.isolation should be run separately from other tests.
# To run only isolation tests: pytest -m isolation
# To run all tests except isolation tests: pytest -m "not isolation"
#
