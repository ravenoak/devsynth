# Expand Phase Command

Generate multiple diverse approaches for implementing: {{user_request}}

## Instructions

1. **Explore Multiple Approaches**: Generate at least 3-5 different implementation strategies
2. **Consider Architecture**: Reference existing patterns in `src/devsynth/` and architectural specifications
3. **Review Requirements**: Check relevant specifications in `docs/specifications/` and BDD scenarios in `tests/behavior/features/`
4. **Evaluate Trade-offs**: Document pros, cons, and trade-offs for each approach
5. **Technical Feasibility**: Consider implementation complexity, testing requirements, and maintenance implications

## Implementation Guidance

### Reference Materials
- **Specifications**: Check `docs/specifications/` for detailed requirements
- **Architecture**: Follow patterns in `src/devsynth/` and `docs/architecture/`
- **Examples**: Use `examples/` for implementation patterns
- **Tests**: Reference `tests/behavior/features/` for acceptance criteria

### Quality Standards
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensure approaches cover all functional and non-functional requirements
- **Architectural Alignment**: Verify compatibility with hexagonal architecture and existing patterns
- **Testing Considerations**: Consider how each approach would be tested (unit, integration, BDD)
- **Security Compliance**: Evaluate security implications of each approach

## Output Format

Present approaches in a structured comparison:

### Approach 1: [Descriptive Name]
