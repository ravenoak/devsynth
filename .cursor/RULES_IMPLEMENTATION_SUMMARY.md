### 3. Legacy Preservation

- Backed up original `rules` file to `rules.legacy`

- Ensured no information loss

## Multi-Disciplined Approach Implementation

Successfully integrated four complementary methodologies throughout all rules:

### 1. Dialectical Reasoning (Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis)
- Implemented in specifications workflow
- Required for significant PR descriptions
- Guides root cause analysis in bug fixes
- Documented in commit messages

### 2. Socratic Method (Question-Driven)
- **What is the problem?** → Problem statements in specifications
- **What proofs confirm?** → Acceptance criteria in specifications
- Applied in all workflow guides
- Enforced in BDD feature creation

### 3. Systems Thinking (Interconnected Components)
- Traceability between specs, tests, code, docs
- Ripple effect considerations
- Integration testing emphasis
- Verification scripts for consistency

### 4. Holistic Perspective (Complete Lifecycle)
- Planning (specifications)
- Development (BDD workflow)
- Quality (testing, style)
- Security (compliance, audits)
- Collaboration (commits, PRs)
- Maintenance (documentation)

## Best Practices Applied

### Cursor IDE Best Practices
✅ **Modular structure** - Each rule under 500 lines, focused
✅ **Front matter metadata** - Description, globs, alwaysApply
✅ **Context-aware globs** - Rules activate for relevant files
✅ **Concrete examples** - Practical code samples throughout
✅ **Actionable guidance** - Clear instructions, not vague suggestions
✅ **Composable rules** - Rules work together, not in conflict

### Documentation Best Practices
✅ **Clear structure** - Logical organization, easy navigation
✅ **Quick reference** - Commands and patterns readily available
✅ **Comprehensive coverage** - All aspects of development addressed
✅ **Graduated detail** - Quick start + deep dive sections
✅ **Cross-references** - Links between related content
✅ **Version tracking** - Documented changes and evolution

### Development Best Practices
✅ **Specification-first** - Enforced via workflows
✅ **Test-driven** - Mandatory failing tests before implementation
✅ **Quality gates** - Multiple verification points
✅ **Security-conscious** - Policy enforcement throughout
✅ **Audit compliance** - Dialectical audit requirements
✅ **Conventional commits** - Standardized commit messages

## File Statistics

### Rules Files
- Core rules: 1 file (267 lines)
- Context-specific: 6 files (1,544 lines)
- Workflows: 3 files (1,380 lines)
