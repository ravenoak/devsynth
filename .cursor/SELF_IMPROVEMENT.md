## üîß Core Features

### Automated Rule Generation

The system automatically analyzes your codebase and suggests new rules:

```bash
# Analyze codebase and generate rule suggestions
python .cursor/hooks/auto_rule_generator.py --source src tests --rules-dir .cursor/rules
```

**Detected Patterns Include**:
- Import organization inconsistencies
- Missing docstrings in functions/classes
- Debug code in production files
- TODO/FIXME comments
- Inconsistent error handling
- Repetitive code patterns

### Rule Validation & Improvement

Comprehensive validation of existing rules:

```bash
# Validate all rules
python .cursor/hooks/rule_validator.py --validate

# Generate health report
python .cursor/hooks/rule_validator.py --health-report

# Improve low-scoring rules
python .cursor/hooks/rule_validator.py --improve
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- **YAML Frontmatter**: Required fields, proper formatting, valid globs
- **Content Quality**: Clarity, specificity, completeness, examples
- **Consistency**: No conflicting guidance, proper cross-references
- **Effectiveness**: Usage patterns, error rates, success rates

### Real-Time Analytics

Monitor system performance and usage:

```bash
# System overview for last 24 hours
python .cursor/hooks/analytics_monitor.py --system-overview 24

# Rule-specific analytics
python .cursor/hooks/analytics_monitor.py --rule-analytics import_organization

# Comprehensive analytics report
python .cursor/hooks/analytics_monitor.py --generate-report
```

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Rule application frequency and success rates
- Command execution patterns and performance
- Error occurrence and resolution patterns
- Context effectiveness and improvement suggestions

### Pattern Learning

The system learns from development patterns:

```bash
# Record a learning event
python .cursor/self_improvement.py --learn code_review security high

# Get actionable insights
python .cursor/hooks/pattern_learner.py --get-insights

# Analyze rule effectiveness
python .cursor/hooks/pattern_learner.py --analyze-rules
```

**Learning Capabilities**:
- **Error Pattern Detection**: Identifies recurring errors that could be prevented
- **Success Pattern Recognition**: Identifies effective approaches to replicate
- **Context Analysis**: Learns which contexts lead to better outcomes
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies improving or declining effectiveness

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Development Workflow Integration

#### 1. Enhanced EDRR Workflow

```bash
# Start with expand phase
/expand-phase user authentication system

# AI generates multiple approaches and analyzes them
# System monitors this interaction and learns from the context

# Move to differentiate phase
/differentiate-phase authentication approaches

# System tracks decision-making process and outcome quality

# Implement in refine phase
/refine-phase implement OAuth2 with FastAPI

# System monitors implementation quality and learns from patterns
```

#### 2. Automatic Rule Improvement

The system continuously improves rules based on usage:

```python
# System detects that a rule has low effectiveness
# Generates improvement suggestions automatically
# Applies improvements if confidence is high enough
# Tracks the impact of improvements over time
```

#### 3. Context-Aware Assistance

```python
# System learns that certain contexts work better
# Adjusts rule application based on learned patterns
# Provides increasingly accurate guidance over time
```

### Hook Integration

Hooks are automatically triggered during development:

```python
# When code is generated
on_code_generated(code_snippet, file_path)

# When errors occur
on_error_occurred(error_message, context)

# When sessions end
on_session_end(session_data)
```

**Hook Events**:
- `RULE_LOADED`: When a rule is loaded into context
- `RULE_APPLIED`: When a rule influences AI behavior
- `COMMAND_EXECUTED`: When a Cursor command is run
- `CODE_GENERATED`: When code is generated by AI
- `ERROR_OCCURRED`: When an error happens during development
- `PATTERN_DETECTED`: When a pattern is detected in code
- `SESSION_STARTED`: When a development session begins
- `SESSION_ENDED`: When a development session ends
