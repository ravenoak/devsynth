## Remediation Strategy

### Phase 1: Documentation Gaps for Tested Features (High Priority)
Create missing documentation for the 59 features that have tests but no docs.

### Phase 2: Test Coverage for Documented Features (Medium Priority)
Add tests for the 40 features that are documented but untested.

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning (Low Priority)
Assess which of the 119 referenced features should be implemented for v0.1.0a1.

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Phase 1 - document tested features
2. Focus on core functionality first
3. Update issue tracker with remediation plan
4. Create implementation timeline
