"""DevSynth package metadata and lightweight helpers.

The package previously imported logging helpers and application subpackages
eagerly.  This made ``import devsynth`` expensive and caused unwanted side
effects during test runs.  The module now exposes lightweight wrappers that
lazyâ€‘load logging utilities on demand and provides an explicit initialization
helper for tests or applications that require certain subpackages to be loaded
ahead of time.
