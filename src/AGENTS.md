# AGENTS for src/ (AI Contributors)

AI contributors working in `src/` should:

- Follow the specification-first BDD workflow: add a spec in `docs/specifications/` and a failing feature in `tests/behavior/features/` before coding.
- Apply the Socratic checklist: what is the problem and what proofs confirm the solution?
- Adhere to the [Dialectical Audit Policy](../docs/policies/dialectical_audit.md) and [Code Style Guide](../docs/developer_guides/code_style.md).
- Run the environment provisioning script and execute commands with `poetry run`.
- Complete the standard pre-PR checks listed in [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).
