# DevSynth Code Example

This walkthrough demonstrates generating implementation code from tests.

## Steps

1. **Make sure tests exist**
   The `tests/` directory should contain the generated test cases.

2. **Run the code command**
   ```bash
   devsynth code
   ```
   DevSynth writes the implementation files under `src/` to satisfy the tests.
