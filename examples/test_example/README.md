# DevSynth Test Example

This walkthrough shows how to generate tests from the project specifications.

## Steps

1. **Ensure specs are generated**
   The file `specs.md` should contain your specifications.

2. **Run the test command**
   ```bash
   devsynth test
   ```
   DevSynth creates tests in the `tests/` directory based on your specs.
