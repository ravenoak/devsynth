Runtime evidence: run of CLI option parsing tests
Date: 2025-09-03 10:52 (local)
Command: pytest -q -o addopts="" tests/unit/application/cli/test_run_tests_cmd_options.py

Results:
- 3 passed, 6 warnings in ~0.83s
- Tests:
  * test_feature_flags_set_environment
  * test_no_parallel_flag_is_passed_to_runner
  * test_segment_options_are_propagated

Notes:
- Used -o addopts="" to bypass repository-level coverage gating for this focused run.
- Warnings are from environment/site-packages and unrelated to the tested CLI behavior.
