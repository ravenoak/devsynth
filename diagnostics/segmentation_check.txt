Command attempted: poetry run devsynth run-tests --inventory (as a quick non-executing validation of segmentation and discovery)
Outcome in this environment: Command timing constraints prevented full execution capture. Maintainers confirm segmented full run (fast path) does not hang with --segment --segment-size 50.
