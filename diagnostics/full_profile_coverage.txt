DevSynth Runtime Evidence â€” Full Profile Coverage Run
Date: 2025-09-30 16:20 (UTC)
Environment:
- PYTHONPATH=src
- DEVSYNTH_NO_FILE_LOGGING=1
- DEVSYNTH_RESOURCE_LMSTUDIO_AVAILABLE=false
- pytest/pytest-cov/pytest-bdd/click/typer installed via `poetry run pip install`
Command:
  PYTHONPATH=src poetry run python -m pytest \
    --collect-only -q

Result summary (current attempt):
- Command executed to validate environment prior to full fast+medium gate.
- Collection aborted with 409 errors: missing optional dependencies (e.g., numpy, GUI backends) and misregistered pytest marks.
- Coverage artifacts were not generated; gating remains blocked until dependencies are provisioned.
- Follow-up action: install full optional stack (memory backends, GUI providers) before re-running
  `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --report --no-parallel` to produce `test_reports/coverage.json`.
