# run-tests CLI stalls on networkx import
Milestone: 0.1.0a1
Status: resolved
Priority: high
Affected Area: cli
Dependencies: poetry install --with dev --extras "tests retrieval chromadb api"

## Problem Statement
Invoking the test runner via `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --report --no-parallel` produces no output and never completes. The CLI also hangs when requesting help, blocking coverage generation.

## Root Cause
NetworkX import recursion causing CLI startup to hang. NetworkX has complex import dependencies that can cause circular import issues in certain environments.

## Resolution
Test suite now runs successfully via both CLI and direct pytest execution. The hanging issue appears to be resolved through dependency updates and environment stabilization during v0.1.0a1 preparation.

## Action Plan
- [x] Minimize startup imports to avoid networkx recursion.
- [x] Provide a non-CLI fallback for running tests until the hang is resolved.
- [x] Capture diagnostics to isolate the import loop.

## Progress
- 2025-09-15: Fresh environment prepared with `poetry install --with dev --extras "tests retrieval chromadb api"`; run-tests command hangs without output.
- 2025-09-15: `poetry run devsynth --help` terminated with `KeyboardInterrupt` while importing `networkx`.
- 2025-10-29: Test suite runs successfully. CLI commands execute without hanging. Issue appears resolved through dependency stabilization and environment improvements.

## Resolution Evidence
- `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast` completes successfully
- `poetry run devsynth --help` displays help without hanging
- Coverage generation works via both CLI and direct pytest execution
