# Dialectical audit documentation

Priority: medium

## Problem Statement
The dialectical audit reports multiple features with tests but lacking documentation, and some features referenced in docs or tests are absent in code. This gap impedes traceability and release readiness.

## Action Plan
- Document features flagged in `dialectical_audit.log` (e.g., CLI Entrypoint, Logger Configuration, Metrics Module).
- Cross-check code to ensure features referenced in docs or tests are implemented or remove stale references.
- Re-run `scripts/dialectical_audit.py` to confirm all questions resolved.

## Progress
- 2025-08-23: Opened ticket to track missing documentation and implementation referenced by dialectical audit.
- 2025-10-21: Closed after publishing the dialectical audit traceability matrix and implementation report, mapping each question to documentation, tests, and code evidence.【F:docs/specifications/dialectical_audit_traceability.md†L1-L140】【F:docs/implementation/dialectical_audit_traceability_report.md†L1-L200】
