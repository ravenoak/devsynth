# Restore strict typing for devsynth.cli
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1
Status: closed

## Problem Statement
`devsynth.cli` used a mypy override to ignore missing imports because Typer lacked bundled type hints.

## Action Plan
- [x] Upgrade Typer to a typed release.
- [x] Remove the `ignore_missing_imports` override from `pyproject.toml`.
- [x] Verify `poetry run mypy src/devsynth` passes.
- [x] Update `issues/typing_relaxations_tracking.md`.

Closed on 2025-09-14 after confirming `devsynth.cli` has fully annotated
parameters and return types with no remaining `type: ignore` comments.
