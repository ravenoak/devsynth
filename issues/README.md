# In-Repo Issue Tracking

This directory contains the active ticketing system for DevSynth. It does not integrate with GitHub Issues.

## Naming Conventions

- Each ticket is named `<number>.md` in ascending order (e.g., `132.md`).
- The first line must follow `# Issue <number>: <title>`.

## Ticket Template

- Start new tickets by copying `TEMPLATE.md` and renaming it to the next number.
- Populate the Summary, Tasks, and References sections.

## Archive Policy

- When a ticket is closed, move it to `archive/<number>.md`.
- Archived files are immutable; open new tickets for follow-up work.
