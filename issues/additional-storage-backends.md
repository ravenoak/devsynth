# Additional Storage Backends
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1
Status: in progress
Priority: low
Dependencies: docs/specifications/additional-storage-backends.md, tests/behavior/features/additional_storage_backends.feature

## Problem Statement
DevSynth currently relies on a single storage backend, limiting deployment
flexibility and resilience. Different environments may require alternative
backends for scalability or persistence guarantees.

## Action Plan
- Define a pluggable interface for storage adapters.
- Evaluate candidates such as Postgres or S3-compatible object stores.
- Implement at least one additional backend using the adapter interface.
- Add configuration and documentation for selecting a backend.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: extracted from dialectical audit backlog.

## References
- None
