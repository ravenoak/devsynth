# Missing BDD tests
Milestone: 0.1.0a1
Status: open
Priority: medium
Dependencies:

## Problem Statement
Many specifications lack corresponding behavior-driven tests, which limits confidence that 90% coverage reflects system-wide behavior.

## Action Plan
- Inventory specifications without BDD feature files or step definitions.
- Implement missing features under tests/behavior/features/ and link them to their specifications.
- Update coverage reports once scenarios are in place.

## Current Gap Inventory
- None; all referenced specifications now have BDD feature coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each identified specification has a matching BDD feature file.
- Aggregated coverage with new behavior tests continues to meet the 90% threshold.

## Progress
- 2025-10-15: `poetry run python scripts/verify_requirements_traceability.py` flagged missing feature files for devsynth_specification, specification_evaluation, devsynth_specification_mvp_updated, testing_infrastructure, and executive_summary.
- 2025-10-16: Added feature files for these specifications and reran traceability check â€“ all references present.
