# Restore strict typing for `devsynth.interface.mvuu_dashboard`

## Summary

The MVUU dashboard helpers still accept arbitrary payloads and return loosely
typed dictionaries. The override stays in place until the dashboard adopts the
Streamlit protocols and typed result contracts.

## Tasks

- [ ] Annotate MVUU dashboard rendering helpers with explicit types.
- [ ] Sanitize join operations to require `Sequence[str]` inputs.
- [ ] Remove the override and update the typing relaxation tracker.

## Evidence

- TODO `typing-interface-mvuu-dashboard` recorded in `pyproject.toml`.
