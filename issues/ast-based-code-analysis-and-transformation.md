# AST-Based Code Analysis and Transformation
Milestone: 0.1.0-beta.1
Status: in progress
Priority: medium
Dependencies: Phase-1-completion.md, docs/specifications/ast-based-code-analysis-and-transformation.md, tests/behavior/features/ast_based_code_analysis_and_transformation.feature

## Problem Statement
AST-Based Code Analysis and Transformation is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.


## Action Plan
- Review `docs/specifications/ast-based-code-analysis-and-transformation.md` for requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Add or update BDD tests in `tests/behavior/features/ast_based_code_analysis_and_transformation.feature`.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: extracted from dialectical audit backlog.
