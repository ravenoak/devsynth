Status: Open
Updated: 2025-08-24

## Summary
TBD — Collect failures from tests/unit/application/memory.

## Thesis / Antithesis / Synthesis
- Thesis: TBD
- Antithesis: TBD
- Synthesis: TBD

## Proposed Fix
- Steps: TBD
- Tests: Ensure graceful handling of missing LMDB in minimal installs; validate transaction safety.

## Acceptance Criteria (BDD)

When run under minimal extras without LMDB
Then tests skip or pass with helpful messages; transaction handling remains correct.

## Impact / Risk
Low; localized to memory adapters.
