# Unit: application/requirements — Triage

Status: Open
Updated: 2025-08-24

## Summary
TBD — Collect failures from tests/unit/application/requirements.

## Thesis / Antithesis / Synthesis
- Thesis: TBD
- Antithesis: TBD
- Synthesis: TBD

## Proposed Fix
- Steps: TBD
- Tests: Add/adjust unit tests ensuring determinism; seed via fixture.

## Acceptance Criteria (BDD)
Given the unit tests for requirements processing
When they are run with minimal extras and seeded environment
Then all previously failing tests pass and reasoning outputs are deterministic across runs.

## Impact / Risk
Low-medium; touches reasoning determinism and hooks.
