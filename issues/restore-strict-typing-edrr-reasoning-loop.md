# Restore strict typing for devsynth.methodology.edrr.reasoning_loop
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1
Status: open

## Problem Statement
`devsynth.methodology.edrr.reasoning_loop` disables `disallow_untyped_defs` and `check_untyped_defs` in `pyproject.toml`, reducing type safety.

## Action Plan
- [ ] Refactor `reasoning_loop` for full type annotations.
- [ ] Remove the mypy override from `pyproject.toml`.
- [ ] Update `issues/typing_relaxations_tracking.md` and close this issue.
