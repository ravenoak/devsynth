# Restore strict typing for devsynth.methodology.edrr.reasoning_loop
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1
Status: closed

## Problem Statement
`devsynth.methodology.edrr.reasoning_loop` disables `disallow_untyped_defs` and `check_untyped_defs` in `pyproject.toml`, reducing type safety.

## Action Plan
- [x] Refactor `reasoning_loop` for full type annotations.
- [x] Remove the mypy override from `pyproject.toml`.
- [x] Update `issues/typing_relaxations_tracking.md` and close this issue.

Closed on 2025-09-14 after annotating `reasoning_loop` and confirming the mypy override removal.
