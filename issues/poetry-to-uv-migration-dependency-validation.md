# Poetry-to-uv Migration: Validate Dependency Management
Milestone: 0.2.0-alpha.1
Status: planning
Priority: high
Dependencies: issues/poetry-to-uv-migration-parallel-env.md

## Problem Statement
We must ensure uv correctly handles all DevSynth dependencies, including complex optional extras, platform-specific dependencies, and version constraints.

## Action Plan
- Compare dependency resolution between Poetry and uv
- Test installation of all dependency groups and extras
- Validate platform-specific dependencies (Linux/macOS differences)
- Test dependency updates and additions
- Verify lockfile consistency and reproducibility

## Acceptance Criteria
- All dependencies install without errors in uv environment
- Dependency versions match Poetry resolution exactly
- All optional extras (tests, retrieval, chromadb, api, etc.) work
- Platform-specific dependencies resolve correctly
- Lockfile reproducible across different machines
- Performance benchmarks show expected improvements

## Progress
- 2025-10-28: Task created

## References
- Current Poetry dependency resolution
- Optional extras: tests, retrieval, chromadb, memory, api, webui, gui, etc.
- Platform markers: Linux x86_64, macOS arm64 exclusions
