# Poetry-to-uv Migration Epic
Milestone: 0.2.0-alpha.1
Status: planning
Priority: high
Dependencies: none

## Problem Statement
DevSynth currently uses Poetry for dependency management, but uv offers significant performance improvements (3x faster CI builds, faster dependency resolution) and modern Python packaging standards compliance. The project has deep Poetry integration across scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and development workflows that need systematic migration to maintain system stability.

## Action Plan
- [Audit] Complete comprehensive audit of current Poetry usage across codebase (issues/poetry-to-uv-migration-audit.md)
- [Research] Research uv compatibility and establish migration strategy (issues/poetry-to-uv-migration-uv-research.md)
- [Planning] Create detailed migration plan with timelines and risk mitigation (issues/poetry-to-uv-migration-plan.md)
- [Setup] Set up parallel uv environment for testing (issues/poetry-to-uv-migration-parallel-env.md)
- [Validation] Validate dependency management functionality (issues/poetry-to-uv-migration-dependency-validation.md)
- [Scripts] Migrate core scripts and configurations (issues/poetry-to-uv-migration-scripts-migration.md)
- [CI/CD] Update GitHub workflows and CI/CD pipelines (issues/poetry-to-uv-migration-workflows-migration.md)
- [Testing] Perform comprehensive testing and validation (issues/poetry-to-uv-migration-comprehensive-testing.md)
- [Documentation] Update documentation and guides (issues/poetry-to-uv-migration-documentation-update.md)
- [Deployment] Execute production deployment with monitoring (issues/poetry-to-uv-migration-deployment-monitoring.md)
- [Risk Management] Implement risk mitigation and contingency planning (issues/poetry-to-uv-migration-risk-mitigation.md)
