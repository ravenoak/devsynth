# Restore strict typing for `devsynth.interface.shared_bridge`

## Summary

`shared_bridge` offers base bridge utilities with minimal annotations. Strict
typing is postponed until progress and WebUI bridges converge on shared
protocols.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add method annotations and remove legacy `type: ignore` comments.
- [ ] Align attribute initialization with the typed bridge protocols.
- [ ] Remove the override and refresh tracking documentation.

## Evidence

- TODO `typing-interface-shared-bridge` recorded in `pyproject.toml`.
