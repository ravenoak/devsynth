# Restore strict typing for devsynth.application.memory.adapters.*
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1
Status: open

## Problem Statement
Modules under `devsynth.application.memory.adapters.*` use `ignore_errors=true` in `pyproject.toml`, disabling type checks.

## Resolution
- Added preliminary type annotations for memory adapters.
- Removed the `ignore_errors` override from `pyproject.toml` and narrowed other memory relaxations.
- `poetry run pre-commit` still surfaces mypy failures across unrelated modules.
- `poetry run mypy src/devsynth/application/memory/adapters` aborts with errors from upstream packages.
- `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast` not executed due to typing gate.

## Action Plan
- [x] Add type annotations for memory adapters.
- [x] Remove the `ignore_errors` override from `pyproject.toml`.
- [x] Update `issues/typing_relaxations_tracking.md` and close this issue.
