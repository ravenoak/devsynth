# Critical recommendations follow-up
Milestone: Phase 1
Status: in progress

Priority: high
Dependencies: [Implement SDLC security audits](archived/implement-sdlc-security-audits.md), [Resolve remaining dialectical audit questions](archived/Resolve-remaining-dialectical-audit-questions.md), docs/specifications/critical-recommendations-follow-up.md, tests/behavior/features/critical_recommendations_follow_up.feature

## Problem Statement
Critical recommendations follow-up is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.


This issue captures remaining work from the critical recommendations report.

- Address security improvements for deployment.
- Refine EDRR coordination behavior and missing step definitions.
- Update documentation to reflect implemented recommendations.

## Action Plan
- Define the detailed requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Create appropriate tests to validate behavior.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: awaiting security audit implementation and audit question resolution.
- [x] Implemented phase transition helpers and recovery hooks with unit tests ([21c6da3a](../commit/21c6da3a)).
- [x] Linked WSDE team consensus with EDRR phase transitions and added cross-store memory sync integration tests ([797e9976](../commit/797e9976)).
- [x] Added coordinator helpers for recovery hooks and threshold overrides with recursive recovery tests.
- 2025-08-17: dependencies resolved; follow-up work continues.
