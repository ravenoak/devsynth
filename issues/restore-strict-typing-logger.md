# Restore strict typing for devsynth.logger
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1
Status: closed

## Problem Statement
`devsynth.logger` uses `ignore_errors=true` in `pyproject.toml`, bypassing mypy validation.

## Resolution
- Added type hints for logging handlers and log records.
- Confirmed no `type: ignore` comments remain.
- `poetry run mypy src/devsynth/logger.py` reported no issues.
- `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast` produced no output in this environment.
- Closed on 2025-09-14.

## Action Plan
- [x] Add type annotations to logger module.
- [x] Remove the `ignore_errors` override from `pyproject.toml`.
- [x] Update `issues/typing_relaxations_tracking.md` and close this issue.
