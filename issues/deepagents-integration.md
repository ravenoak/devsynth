# DeepAgents Integration for Enhanced Agent Capabilities
Milestone: v0.2.0
Status: planned
Priority: high
Dependencies: agentic_memory_management.md, edrr_cycle_specification.md, wsde_edrr_collaboration.md

## Problem Statement

DevSynth agents currently lack advanced capabilities for complex task planning, context management, and subagent coordination that are available in LangChain's DeepAgents library. Integration would enhance DevSynth's ability to handle multi-step development tasks while maintaining architectural integrity.

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Planning Tools Integration
- Integrate DeepAgents `write_todos` tool into EDRR Expand phase
- Enable systematic task decomposition for complex requirements
- Add planning capabilities to specification writing workflows

### Phase 2: Context Management Enhancement
- Implement DeepAgents file system tools (`ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`)
- Prevent context window overflow in long development sessions
- Enable external storage of large tool outputs and intermediate results

### Phase 3: Subagent Architecture
- Implement DeepAgents subagent spawning for specialized tasks
- Enable context isolation for focused development subtasks
- Integrate subagent results back into main EDRR workflow

### Phase 4: Long-term Memory Bridge
- Connect DeepAgents persistent memory with DevSynth hybrid memory system
- Ensure continuity across extended agent conversations
- Preserve critical architectural decisions across sessions

## Progress
- ✅ Updated agentic_memory_management.md specification
- ✅ Updated edrr_cycle_specification.md with planning tools
- ✅ Updated wsde_edrr_collaboration.md with subagent integration
- ⏳ Implementation of DeepAgents adapter layer
- ⏳ Integration testing with existing agent workflows
- ⏳ Dialectical audit compliance verification
