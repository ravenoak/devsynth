# Prompt Management with DPSy-AI
Milestone: 0.1.0
Status: closed
Priority: low
Dependencies: Phase-2-completion.md, docs/specifications/prompt-management-with-dpsy-ai.md, tests/behavior/features/prompt_management_with_dpsy_ai.feature

## Problem Statement
Prompt Management with DPSy-AI is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.


## Action Plan
- Review `docs/specifications/prompt-management-with-dpsy-ai.md` for requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Add or update BDD tests in `tests/behavior/features/prompt_management_with_dpsy_ai.feature`.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: extracted from dialectical audit backlog.
- 2025-09-21: Prompt management specification now in review with scenarios covering registration, rendering, and versioning plus supporting unit tests.【F:docs/specifications/prompt-management-with-dpsy-ai.md†L1-L71】【F:tests/behavior/features/prompt_management_with_dpsy_ai.feature†L1-L23】【F:tests/behavior/steps/test_prompt_management_steps.py†L1-L410】
