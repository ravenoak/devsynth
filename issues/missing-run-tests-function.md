Title: Missing run_tests function in testing/run_tests.py
Date: 2025-09-24 14:30 PST
Status: closed
Affected Area: tests
Reproduction:
  - `poetry run devsynth doctor`
  - `poetry run devsynth run-tests --help`
Exit Code: 1 (ImportError)
Artifacts:
  - src/devsynth/testing/run_tests.py (restored function)
Suspected Cause: The `run_tests` function was missing from the module despite being imported by `run_tests_cmd.py`. The module docstring referenced the function but it was not implemented.
Next Actions:
  - [x] Implement missing `run_tests` function based on test signatures
  - [x] Add supporting helper functions `_run_segmented_tests` and `_run_single_test_batch`
  - [x] Complete collection cache function that was truncated
  - [x] Verify CLI functionality restored
Resolution Evidence:
  - Function implemented with full signature matching test expectations
  - CLI commands now execute without import errors
  - Smoke test inventory mode accessible (though hanging on collection)

Root Cause Analysis:
The function was accidentally removed or never completed during development. The module had helper functions and constants but was missing the main entry point that the CLI depends on. This was a critical blocker preventing any test execution.

Impact: CRITICAL - Prevented all DevSynth CLI test execution
Priority: P0 (Release Blocker)
Fixed: 2025-09-24 by implementing complete function with proper error handling and segmentation support.
