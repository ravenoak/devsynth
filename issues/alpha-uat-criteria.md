# User Acceptance Testing Criteria - v0.1.0a1 Alpha

**Date**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: ready  
**Release**: v0.1.0a1  
**Quality Level**: Alpha  

## Alpha Release UAT Philosophy

Alpha releases focus on **functional completeness** and **basic stability** rather than production-level quality. The goal is to validate core concepts and gather user feedback.

## Core Functional Requirements

### 1. CLI Basic Operations ✅
- [x] `devsynth --help` displays command reference
- [x] `devsynth doctor` runs environment validation  
- [x] `devsynth --version` shows correct version
- [ ] `devsynth init` creates basic project structure
- [ ] `devsynth spec` generates specifications from requirements
- [ ] `devsynth test` generates tests from specifications
- [ ] `devsynth code` generates code from tests

### 2. Environment Stability ✅
- [x] Poetry environment setup works
- [x] Dependencies install correctly
- [x] Basic logging functions
- [x] Configuration system loads

### 3. Core Architecture Validation
- [ ] Agent system initializes
- [ ] Memory backends connect (at least one: TinyDB or in-memory)
- [ ] Provider system works with stub/offline providers
- [ ] Basic EDRR workflow executes

### 4. Quality Gates (Alpha Level)
- [ ] **Coverage ≥70%** (adjusted from 90% for alpha)
- [ ] **Core tests pass** (unit tests for critical paths)
- [ ] **Basic smoke tests pass** (no critical failures)
- [ ] **No security vulnerabilities** (Bandit scan clean)

## User Journey Validation

### Primary Workflow: Project Initialization
```bash
# User creates new project
mkdir test-project && cd test-project
devsynth init
# Should create basic structure without errors
```

### Secondary Workflow: Basic EDRR Cycle  
```bash
# User runs basic specification generation
echo "Build a calculator" > requirements.txt
devsynth spec --requirements-file requirements.txt
# Should generate basic specification
```

### Tertiary Workflow: System Health
```bash
# User checks system health
devsynth doctor
# Should report status without critical errors
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have (Release Blockers)
1. **CLI Functional**: All basic commands execute without crashing
2. **Environment Stable**: Fresh installation works reliably  
3. **Core Tests Pass**: Critical functionality validated
4. **Coverage ≥70%**: Reasonable test coverage achieved
5. **Documentation Current**: Basic usage documented

### Nice to Have (Post-Alpha)
1. **WebUI Functional**: Streamlit interface works
2. **Full EDRR Cycle**: End-to-end workflow completion
3. **Advanced Features**: Multi-agent collaboration, advanced memory
4. **Coverage ≥90%**: Production-level coverage
5. **Performance Optimized**: Response time optimization

## Testing Approach

### Functional Testing Priority
1. **Smoke Tests**: Basic command execution
2. **Integration Tests**: Core workflows end-to-end  
3. **Unit Tests**: Critical business logic
4. **Edge Cases**: Error handling, boundary conditions

### Coverage Strategy
- **Target 70%** overall coverage
- **Focus on critical paths** rather than comprehensive coverage
- **Prioritize user-facing functionality**
- **Defer complex internal logic** to post-alpha

## Success Metrics

### Alpha Release Success
- [ ] 3+ core CLI commands work end-to-end
- [ ] Basic project initialization succeeds
- [ ] System passes health checks
- [ ] Coverage ≥70% with meaningful tests
- [ ] No critical security issues

### User Feedback Goals
- Validate core concept and architecture
- Identify most valuable features for beta
- Understand user workflow preferences
- Gather performance and usability feedback

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Test Infrastructure Complexity**: Use working tests, defer complex scenarios
- **Coverage Measurement Issues**: Focus on functional validation
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Maintain working dependency set

### Process Risks  
- **Over-Engineering**: Maintain alpha-appropriate scope
- **Perfectionism**: Accept "good enough" for alpha quality
- **Scope Creep**: Defer nice-to-have features

## Sign-off Requirements

### Technical Sign-off
- [ ] Core functionality demonstrated
- [ ] Basic test coverage achieved (≥70%)
- [ ] No critical issues identified
- [ ] Environment setup documented

### Product Sign-off  
- [ ] User value proposition clear
- [ ] Core workflows functional
- [ ] Feedback collection plan ready
- [ ] Post-alpha roadmap defined

## Conclusion

This UAT approach balances quality assurance with pragmatic alpha release goals, focusing on functional completeness and user value over perfect metrics.
