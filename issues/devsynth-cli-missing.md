# devsynth CLI missing after setup
Milestone: 0.1.0a1
Status: open
Priority: medium
Dependencies: scripts/install_dev.sh, poetry install --with dev --all-extras

## Problem Statement
Fresh environments lack the `devsynth` CLI entry point, producing `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'devsynth'` when running project commands before installation completes.

## Action Plan
- [x] Ensure `poetry install --with dev --all-extras` runs during environment provisioning.
- [x] Document this requirement in maintainer setup guides.
- [x] Add checks to `scripts/install_dev.sh` to verify the entry point exists and guide users if missing.

## Progress
- 2025-09-12: Encountered missing `devsynth` CLI; running `poetry install --with dev --all-extras` restored functionality.
- 2025-09-12: scripts/install_dev.sh now runs `poetry install --with dev --all-extras` and verifies the `devsynth` entry point.
- 2025-09-15: Reproduced missing CLI in fresh session; `poetry install --with dev --all-extras` restored entry point and smoke tests passed.
- 2025-09-20: New container session still reports `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'devsynth'` until `poetry install --with dev --all-extras` runs; captured in diagnostics/devsynth_cli_missing_20250920.log and diagnostics/poetry_install_20250920.log for follow-up.
- 2025-09-21: `poetry run devsynth --help` again failed with `ModuleNotFoundError` before reinstall; running `poetry install --with dev --all-extras` restored the CLI and extras, and a follow-up `bash scripts/install_dev.sh` captured a clean bootstrap in diagnostics/install_dev_20250921T054430Z.log.

## Next Actions
- [ ] Update scripts/install_dev.sh (or an equivalent bootstrap hook) to detect the missing entry point and rerun `poetry install --with dev --all-extras` automatically (docs/tasks.md ยง15.5).
