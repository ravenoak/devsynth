# Micro EDRR Cycle
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.2
Status: in progress
Priority: high
Dependencies: docs/specifications/micro-edrr-cycle.md, tests/behavior/features/micro_edrr_cycle.feature

## Problem Statement
Micro EDRR Cycle is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.


## Action Plan
- Review `docs/specifications/micro-edrr-cycle.md` for requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Add or update BDD tests in `tests/behavior/features/micro_edrr_cycle.feature`.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: extracted from dialectical audit backlog.
