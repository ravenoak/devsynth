# API Specification Generation
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.2
Status: in progress
Priority: high
Dependencies: docs/specifications/api-specification-generation.md, tests/behavior/features/api_specification_generation.feature

## Problem Statement
There is no automated process for producing an up-to-date API specification.
Manual specs quickly drift from implementation, leaving consumers without
reliable documentation.

## Action Plan
- Generate an OpenAPI document from the source code or test suite.
- Validate the generated specification in CI.
- Publish the spec as part of the project documentation and WebUI.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: extracted from dialectical audit backlog.
