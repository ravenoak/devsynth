# Restore strict typing for devsynth.application.cli.commands.inspect_code_cmd
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1
Status: closed

## Problem Statement
`devsynth.application.cli.commands.inspect_code_cmd` disables `disallow_untyped_defs` and `check_untyped_defs` in `pyproject.toml`, reducing type safety.

## Action Plan
- [x] Refactor `inspect_code_cmd` to satisfy strict typing.
- [x] Remove the mypy override from `pyproject.toml`.
- [x] Update `issues/typing_relaxations_tracking.md` and close this issue.

## Resolution
Closed on 2025-09-14 after reinstating strict typing for
`devsynth.application.cli.commands.inspect_code_cmd` and removing the
module-specific mypy override.
