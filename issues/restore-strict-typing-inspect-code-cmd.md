# Restore strict typing for devsynth.application.cli.commands.inspect_code_cmd
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1
Status: open

## Problem Statement
`devsynth.application.cli.commands.inspect_code_cmd` disables `disallow_untyped_defs` and `check_untyped_defs` in `pyproject.toml`, reducing type safety.

## Action Plan
- [ ] Refactor `inspect_code_cmd` to satisfy strict typing.
- [ ] Remove the mypy override from `pyproject.toml`.
- [ ] Update `issues/typing_relaxations_tracking.md` and close this issue.
