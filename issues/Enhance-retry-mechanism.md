# Enhance retry mechanism
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.2
Status: open

Priority: high
Dependencies: docs/specifications/enhance-retry-mechanism.md, tests/behavior/features/enhance_retry_mechanism.feature

## Problem Statement
Enhance retry mechanism is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.



The fallback module implements exponential backoff but lacks metrics and conditional logic.

- Add configurable retry conditions and circuit-breaker support
- Record retry statistics for monitoring
- Write regression tests for failure scenarios

## Action Plan
- Define the detailed requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Create appropriate tests to validate behavior.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: design pending; no implementation yet.

- No progress yet
