# Issue 129: Refine environment provisioning to skip heavy GPU packages

Repeated executions of the environment provisioning script attempted to install NVIDIA GPU packages, resulting in endless `Installing nvidia/__init__.py over existing file` messages and a hung process.

## Plan
- Adjust dependency installation to include only required extras.
- Verify the script completes without repeated NVIDIA installation messages.
- Document the expected environment footprint.

## Status
- Environment provisioning script updated to install `tests`, `retrieval`, `chromadb`, and `api` extras only.
- Verification pending.
