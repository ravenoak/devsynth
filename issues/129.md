# Issue 129: Refine environment provisioning to skip heavy GPU packages

Repeated executions of `deployment/bootstrap_env.sh` attempted to install NVIDIA GPU packages, resulting in endless `Installing nvidia/__init__.py over existing file` messages and a hung process.

## Plan
- Adjust dependency installation to include only required extras.
- Verify `deployment/bootstrap_env.sh` completes without repeated NVIDIA installation messages.
- Document the expected environment footprint.

## Status
- `deployment/bootstrap_env.sh` updated to install `tests`, `retrieval`, `chromadb`, and `api` extras only.
- Verification pending.
- Running `deployment/bootstrap_env.sh` produced `No arguments expected for "install" command, got "retrieval"`, leaving verification incomplete.
