# Finalize dialectical reasoning
Milestone: 0.1.0
Status: in progress

Priority: low
Dependencies: Phase-2-completion.md, docs/specifications/finalize-dialectical-reasoning.md, tests/behavior/features/finalize_dialectical_reasoning.feature

## Problem Statement
Finalize dialectical reasoning is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.


This issue tracks tasks needed to finish the dialectical reasoning framework.

- Integrate dialectical reasoning loop into EDRR workflow
- Add consensus failure handling and logging
- Ensure reasoning results persist to memory
- Expand unit tests for reasoning modules

## Action Plan
- Define the detailed requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Create appropriate tests to validate behavior.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: awaiting resolution of audit questions before finalizing reasoning loop.
- [x] Behavior tests confirm reasoning results persist to memory ([2b3f12f7](../commit/2b3f12f7)).
- 2025-08-17: dependencies resolved; finalizing reasoning loop.

- 2025-08-20: specification expanded; WSDE knowledge utilities link to it.
