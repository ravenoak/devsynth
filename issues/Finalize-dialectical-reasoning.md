# Finalize dialectical reasoning
Milestone: 0.1.0
Status: in progress

Priority: low
Dependencies: Phase-2-completion.md, docs/specifications/finalize-dialectical-reasoning.md, tests/behavior/features/finalize_dialectical_reasoning.feature

## Problem Statement
Finalize dialectical reasoning is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.


This issue tracks tasks needed to finish the dialectical reasoning framework.

- Integrate dialectical reasoning loop into EDRR workflow
- Add consensus failure handling and logging
- Ensure reasoning results persist to memory
- Expand unit tests for reasoning modules

## Action Plan
- Define the detailed requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Create appropriate tests to validate behavior.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: awaiting resolution of audit questions before finalizing reasoning loop.
- [x] Behavior tests confirm reasoning results persist to memory ([2b3f12f7](../commit/2b3f12f7)).
- 2025-08-17: dependencies resolved; finalizing reasoning loop.

- 2025-08-20: specification expanded; WSDE knowledge utilities link to it.
- 2025-09-17: Added deterministic safeguards via `tests/unit/methodology/edrr/test_reasoning_loop_invariants.py::{test_reasoning_loop_enforces_total_time_budget,test_reasoning_loop_retries_until_success,test_reasoning_loop_fallback_transitions_and_propagation}` (seed: deterministic/no RNG) to cover recursion limits, retries, and synthesis propagation.
- 2025-09-17: Promoted the reasoning loop invariants note to review with explicit traceability to the dialectical reasoning specification, BDD features, property tests, and deterministic unit regressions that document convergence, propagation, retries, and timeouts.【F:docs/implementation/reasoning_loop_invariants.md†L1-L88】【F:docs/specifications/finalize-dialectical-reasoning.md†L1-L78】【F:tests/behavior/features/finalize_dialectical_reasoning.feature†L1-L16】【F:tests/property/test_reasoning_loop_properties.py†L25-L208】【F:tests/unit/methodology/edrr/test_reasoning_loop_invariants.py†L16-L163】
- 2025-09-17: Published reasoning-loop invariants with a 54 % coverage snapshot and flagged the `_import_apply_dialectical_reasoning` Hypothesis gap for follow-up before re-enabling property coverage claims.【F:docs/implementation/reasoning_loop_invariants.md†L1-L61】【cd0fac†L1-L9】【df7365†L1-L55】
