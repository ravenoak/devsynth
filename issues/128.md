# Issue 128: Normalize and verify test markers

The test suite must ensure each test file contains exactly one speed marker (`fast`, `medium`, or `slow`). Some tests may lack markers, have duplicates, or include outdated placement. High-memory tests must be gated with `memory_intensive`.

## Plan
1. Generate baseline marker report:
   - `poetry run python scripts/verify_test_markers.py` to identify missing or duplicate markers.
2. Normalize markers:
   - `poetry run python scripts/add_missing_markers.py` for unmarked tests.
   - `poetry run python scripts/fix_duplicate_markers.py` for duplicated markers.
   - `poetry run python scripts/standardize_marker_placement.py` to enforce consistent placement.
   - Apply `poetry run python scripts/fix_all_test_markers.py` for any bulk cleanup.
3. Flag resource-heavy tests:
   - Gate high-memory tests with `@pytest.mark.memory_intensive` or refactor to lighter fixtures.
4. Verify:
   - Re-run `poetry run python scripts/verify_test_markers.py` to confirm all files contain exactly one speed marker.
   - Run `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast` followed by `--speed=medium` and `--speed=slow` to validate marker filtering.
5. Document:
   - Update contributing guidelines if marker requirements change.
   - Track progress in issue updates.

## Status

- Initial verification attempt timed out; needs further investigation.
- A second run after provisioning also hung and required manual interruption.
