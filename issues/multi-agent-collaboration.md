# Multi-Agent Collaboration
Milestone: 0.1.0
Status: closed
Priority: low
Dependencies: Phase-2-completion.md, docs/specifications/multi-agent-collaboration.md, tests/behavior/features/multi_agent_collaboration.feature

## Problem Statement
Multi-Agent Collaboration is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.


## Action Plan
- Review `docs/specifications/multi-agent-collaboration.md` for requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Add or update BDD tests in `tests/behavior/features/multi_agent_collaboration.feature`.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: extracted from dialectical audit backlog.
- 2025-09-21: Multi-agent collaboration specification moved to review with BDD coverage and unit support; see docs/specifications/multi-agent-collaboration.md, behavior features, and WSDE agent model step implementations.【F:docs/specifications/multi-agent-collaboration.md†L1-L76】【F:tests/behavior/features/multi_agent_collaboration.feature†L1-L16】【F:tests/behavior/steps/test_wsde_agent_model_steps.py†L1-L331】
