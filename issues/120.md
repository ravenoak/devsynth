# Issue 120: Failing unit tests after environment setup

Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1

Running the environment provisioning script followed by
`poetry run pytest -m "not memory_intensive"` results in multiple
failing tests, particularly in the code analysis pipeline.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Execute the environment provisioning script.
2. Run `poetry run pytest -m "not memory_intensive"`.

## Progress
- Environment provisioning completed without errors.
- `devsynth run-tests --speed=fast` reports two failures in `tests/unit/general/test_provider_logging.py` due to missing `lmstudio`.
- `tests/behavior/test_simple_standalone.py` raises `FileNotFoundError` for required sample files.
- Previous runs also reported failures in `test_repo_analyzer` and `test_transformer`.
- `pip check` confirms no broken requirements.
