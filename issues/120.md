# Issue 120: Failing unit tests after environment setup

Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1

Running the environment provisioning script followed by
`poetry run pytest -m "not memory_intensive"` results in multiple
failing tests, particularly in the code analysis pipeline.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Execute the environment provisioning script.
2. Run `poetry run pytest -m "not memory_intensive"`.

## Progress
- Environment provisioning completed without errors.
- Test run reached roughly 48% before manual interruption.
- Failures observed in `test_repo_analyzer` and `test_transformer`.
- Recent fast test sweep shows additional failures in provider logging (missing `lmstudio`) and missing files for `test_simple_standalone`.
