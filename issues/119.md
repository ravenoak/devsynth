# Issue 119: Pytest `--speed` option unrecognized

Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1

Running `poetry run pytest --speed=fast` results in:
```
pytest: error: unrecognized arguments: --speed=fast
```
The `tests/conftest_extensions.py` plugin is expected to register this flag but appears not to load.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Execute `poetry run pytest --speed=fast`.
2. Observe the unrecognized argument error and exit status 4.

Investigate why the plugin fails to register the option so tests can be filtered by speed again.

## Progress

- Running `poetry run pytest --speed=fast` still produces the unrecognized
  argument error, preventing speed-based test selection.
