# Issue 118: `devsynth run-tests` hangs without output

Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1

Running the `devsynth run-tests` command with or without `--speed` produces the startup banner
but then hangs without completing or displaying results. The process terminates only after
manual interruption, and no pytest processes remain active. This prevents executing the
standard test suite via the provided CLI.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Execute `poetry run devsynth run-tests`.
2. Observe that after the banner, no further output is produced.
3. The command does not exit until interrupted.

Investigate the CLI command so that it reliably runs the test suite and returns an appropriate
exit status and report.

## Progress

- Running `devsynth run-tests --speed=fast` executes and completes, but reports
  failure when no tests match the selected markers.
- Pytest emits a `PytestBenchmarkWarning` on stderr, leading the command to
  treat the run as unsuccessful.
- Further work is needed to handle empty test selections and suppress benign
  warnings so the command exits cleanly.
