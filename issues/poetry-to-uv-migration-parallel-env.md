# Poetry-to-uv Migration: Set Up Parallel uv Environment
Milestone: 0.2.0-alpha.1
Status: planning
Priority: high
Dependencies: issues/poetry-to-uv-migration-plan.md

## Problem Statement
We need a complete uv-based development environment that mirrors the current Poetry setup for testing and validation before full migration.

## Action Plan
- Clean and convert pyproject.toml for uv compatibility
- Generate uv.lock file from current dependencies
- Set up uv-managed virtual environment
- Configure uv equivalent of current Poetry groups and extras
- Test basic functionality (install, run commands, dependency management)

## Acceptance Criteria
- pyproject.toml cleaned of Poetry-specific sections
- uv.lock file generated successfully
- Virtual environment created and activated with uv
- All current optional extras available in uv
- Basic commands (uv run, uv add, uv sync) working
- Environment isolated from current Poetry setup

## Progress
- 2025-10-28: Task created

## References
- Current pyproject.toml configuration
- Poetry extras and groups configuration
- uv project layout documentation
