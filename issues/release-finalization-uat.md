- 2025-09-13: Final fast+medium coverage run attempted; run reported `ERROR tests/unit/general/test_test_first_metrics.py`. Coverage artifacts omitted from commit due to Codex diff size limits.
- 2025-09-13: Verified fresh environment with `poetry install`; smoke tests and verification scripts passed; awaiting UAT and maintainer tagging.
- 2025-09-13: Fixed path handling for `test_first_metrics` and reran coverage; committed updated reports.
