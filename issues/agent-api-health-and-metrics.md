# Agent API Health and Metrics
Milestone: 0.1.0-beta.1
Status: in progress
Priority: medium
Dependencies: docs/specifications/agent-api-health-and-metrics.md, tests/behavior/features/agent_api_health_and_metrics.feature

## Problem Statement
The agent API lacks dedicated health checks and runtime metrics. Without
observability, service outages or performance regressions may go unnoticed until
they affect users.

## Action Plan
- Add a `/health` endpoint that verifies dependent services.
- Instrument API requests with metrics for throughput, latency, and errors.
- Publish metrics in a standard format such as Prometheus.
- Document how to access and interpret the health and metrics data.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: extracted from dialectical audit backlog.

## References
