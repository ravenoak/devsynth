# Consensus Building
Milestone: 0.1.0
Status: completed
Priority: low
Dependencies: Phase-2-completion.md, docs/specifications/consensus-building.md, tests/behavior/features/consensus_building.feature

## Problem Statement
Consensus Building is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.

## Action Plan
- Review `docs/specifications/consensus-building.md` for requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Add or update BDD tests in `tests/behavior/features/consensus_building.feature`.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: extracted from dialectical audit backlog.
- 2025-09-14: consensus utility, invariants, and tests implemented.
- 2025-09-21: Documentation promoted to review with refreshed BDD and unit evidence for consensus workflows.【F:docs/specifications/consensus-building.md†L1-L71】【F:tests/behavior/features/consensus_building.feature†L1-L12】【F:tests/behavior/steps/test_consensus_building_steps.py†L1-L339】
