# Complete memory system integration
Milestone: Phase 1
Status: open

Priority: high
Dependencies: docs/specifications/complete-memory-system-integration.md, tests/behavior/features/complete_memory_system_integration.feature

## Problem Statement
Complete memory system integration is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.



The memory subsystem supports multiple backends but remains unstable.

- Finalize sync manager for LMDB, FAISS, and Kuzu stores
- Harden ChromaDB adapter and transactional semantics
- Expand integration tests covering persistence and retrieval
- Handle missing LMDB dependency more gracefully

## Action Plan
- Define the detailed requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Create appropriate tests to validate behavior.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: backends remain unstable; integration still pending.

- No progress yet

- 2025-08-21: specification expanded and MemoryIntegrationManager documented.
