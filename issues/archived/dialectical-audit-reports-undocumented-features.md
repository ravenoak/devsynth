# Issue 150: Dialectical audit reports undocumented features

Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1
Status: completed

Priority: medium

The latest dialectical audit found numerous features referenced in tests or documentation without corresponding documentation or code. See `dialectical_audit.log` for the full list of open questions.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Run `poetry run python scripts/dialectical_audit.py`.
2. Inspect `dialectical_audit.log` for the reported inconsistencies.
