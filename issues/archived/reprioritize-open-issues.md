# Issue 154: Review and Reprioritize Open Issues
Milestone: Phase 1 (completed 2025-08-20)
Status: closed
Priority: high
Dependencies: docs/specifications/reprioritize-open-issues.md, tests/behavior/features/reprioritize_open_issues.feature

## Problem Statement
The repository tracks 135 open tickets, mostly marked low priority. This distribution may not align with the current roadmap.

## Action Plan
- Audit all open ticket priorities against the roadmap
- Update Priority fields to reflect current goals
- Adjust Dependencies based on roadmap sequencing
- Archive tickets that are complete or obsolete

## Progress
- 2025-08-19: Audited 134 open tickets; prioritized 74 high, 35 medium, 25 low; aligned milestones and dependencies with roadmap phases.
- 2025-08-19: Revalidated all 134 open tickets; priorities remain 74 high, 35 medium, 25 low. Confirmed dependencies align with Phase 1 milestones and found no tickets to archive.
- 2025-08-20: Re-reviewed 134 open tickets after roadmap update; statuses, priorities, and dependencies remain aligned. No completed items identified for archiving.
