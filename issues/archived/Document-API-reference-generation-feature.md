# Issue 148: Document API reference generation feature

Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1 (completed 2025-08-17)
Status: closed

Priority: medium
Dependencies: [Resolve remaining dialectical audit questions](Resolve-remaining-dialectical-audit-questions.md)


Behavior tests cover an "API Reference Documentation Generation" feature, but no user-facing documentation explains how to generate API reference docs.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Review `tests/behavior/features/general/generate_docs.feature`.
2. Search the `docs/` directory for "API Reference Documentation Generation" and find no results.

## Suggested improvement
Add a user guide or section describing how to generate API reference documentation, including any commands or options required.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: documentation still missing; blocked on audit questions.
- Confirmed presence of behavior tests for API reference documentation generation without corresponding documentation.
- Linked with [Resolve remaining dialectical audit questions](Resolve-remaining-dialectical-audit-questions.md).
- 2025-08-17: API reference generation guide added. Issue resolved.
