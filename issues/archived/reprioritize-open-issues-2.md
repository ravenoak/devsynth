# Issue 155: Review and Reprioritize Open Issues
Milestone: 0.1.0-beta.1 (completed 2025-08-20)
Status: closed
Priority: medium
Dependencies: docs/specifications/reprioritize-open-issues.md, tests/behavior/features/reprioritize_open_issues.feature

## Problem Statement
The repository's ticket priorities may drift from the current roadmap. A prior audit (see archived/reprioritize-open-issues.md) aligned Phase 1 work, but new changes require another review.

## Action Plan
- Scan open ticket files for milestone assignments
- Update Priority fields based on milestone
- Commit revised priorities

## Progress
- 2025-08-20: Realigned all open issue milestones and priorities with roadmap milestones.
