# Issue 143: Ensure EDRR coordinator sync hooks fire without memory manager
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1 (completed 2025-08-17)

EDRR coordinator should emit sync hooks even when no memory manager is configured.

## Progress
- Identified that `_sync_memory` returned without notifying hooks when no memory manager was configured.
- Added fallback to emit final sync hook on missing manager or flush failure.
- Resolved in [commit 571e805b](../commit/571e805b).
- Status: closed
