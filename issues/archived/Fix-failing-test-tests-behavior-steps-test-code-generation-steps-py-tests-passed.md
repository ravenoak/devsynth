# Issue 137: Fix failing test tests/behavior/steps/test_code_generation_steps.py::tests_passed

Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1
Status: closed

Priority: high
Dependencies: [tests/behavior/steps/test_code_generation_steps.py](../tests/behavior/steps/test_code_generation_steps.py)


The test `tests/behavior/steps/test_code_generation_steps.py::tests_passed` fails with `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'execute_command'`. Investigate and resolve the failure.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `poetry run pytest tests/behavior/steps/test_code_generation_steps.py::tests_passed`

## Progress
- Reproduced on 2025-08-16; test failed with `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'execute_command'`.
- Renamed the step function to avoid unintended Pytest collection.
- Updated the step to ensure the mock workflow manager is available, resolving the failure.
- Status: closed
