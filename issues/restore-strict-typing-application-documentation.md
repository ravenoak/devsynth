# Restore strict typing for devsynth.application.documentation.*
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1
Status: closed

## Problem Statement
Modules under `devsynth.application.documentation.*` use `ignore_errors=true` in `pyproject.toml`, bypassing all type checking.

## Action Plan
- [x] Add type annotations and resolve typing issues.
- [x] Remove the `ignore_errors` override from `pyproject.toml`.
- [x] Update `issues/typing_relaxations_tracking.md` and close this issue.

## Resolution
Closed on 2025-09-14 after restoring strict typing and updating project tracking.
