# Multi-disciplinary Dialectical Reasoning
Milestone: Phase 3
Status: in progress
Priority: low
Dependencies: Phase 2 completion, docs/specifications/multi-disciplinary-dialectical-reasoning.md, tests/behavior/features/dialectical_reasoning/multi_disciplinary_dialectical_reasoning.feature, tests/behavior/features/multi_disciplinary_dialectical_reasoning.feature

## Problem Statement
Multi-disciplinary Dialectical Reasoning is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.


## Action Plan
- Review `docs/specifications/multi-disciplinary-dialectical-reasoning.md` for requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Add or update BDD tests in `tests/behavior/features/dialectical_reasoning/multi_disciplinary_dialectical_reasoning.feature`.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress

- 2025-08-18: drafted specification and BDD scenario.
- 2025-08-18: dialectical audit flagged missing documentation and implementation; ticket updated.
