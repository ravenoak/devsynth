# Promise System Capability Management
Milestone: 0.1.0
Status: closed
Priority: low
Dependencies: Phase-2-completion.md, docs/specifications/promise-system-capability-management.md, tests/behavior/features/promise_system_capability_management.feature

## Problem Statement
Promise System Capability Management is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.


## Action Plan
- Review `docs/specifications/promise-system-capability-management.md` for requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Add or update BDD tests in `tests/behavior/features/promise_system_capability_management.feature`.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: extracted from dialectical audit backlog.
- 2025-09-21: Promise system specification promoted to review with capability registration, fulfillment, rejection, and chaining scenarios linked to active tests.【F:docs/specifications/promise-system-capability-management.md†L1-L71】【F:tests/behavior/features/promise_system_capability_management.feature†L1-L31】【F:tests/behavior/steps/test_promise_system_steps.py†L1-L399】
