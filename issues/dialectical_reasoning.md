# Dialectical reasoning evaluation hooks
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.2
Status: closed
Priority: medium
Dependencies: docs/specifications/dialectical_reasoning.md, tests/behavior/features/dialectical_reasoning.feature

## Problem Statement
BDD coverage for dialectical reasoning evaluation hooks was missing, limiting traceability for consensus decisions.

## Action Plan
- Implement BDD scenario verifying hook invocation.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-09-12: Added BDD scenario and step definitions confirming hook receives consensus flag; issue closed.
- 2025-09-21: Added property-based coverage for reasoning-loop hooks, documented verification assets, and confirmed hooks observe both consensus outcomes.
