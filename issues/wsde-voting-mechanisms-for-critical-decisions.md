# WSDE Voting Mechanisms for Critical Decisions
Milestone: 0.1.0
Status: closed
Priority: low
Dependencies: Phase-2-completion.md, docs/specifications/wsde-voting-mechanisms-for-critical-decisions.md, tests/behavior/features/wsde_voting_mechanisms_for_critical_decisions.feature

## Problem Statement
WSDE Voting Mechanisms for Critical Decisions is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.


## Action Plan
- Review `docs/specifications/wsde-voting-mechanisms-for-critical-decisions.md` for requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Add or update BDD tests in `tests/behavior/features/wsde_voting_mechanisms_for_critical_decisions.feature`.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: extracted from dialectical audit backlog.
- 2025-09-21: Voting mechanisms documented and validated with weighted voting, tie fallback, and consensus integration scenarios; specification promoted to review.【F:docs/specifications/wsde-voting-mechanisms-for-critical-decisions.md†L1-L71】【F:tests/behavior/features/wsde_voting_mechanisms_for_critical_decisions.feature†L1-L26】【F:tests/behavior/steps/test_wsde_voting_mechanisms_steps.py†L1-L410】
