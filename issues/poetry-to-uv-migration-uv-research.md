# Poetry-to-uv Migration: Research uv Compatibility
Milestone: 0.2.0-alpha.1
Status: planning
Priority: high
Dependencies: issues/poetry-to-uv-migration-epic.md

## Problem Statement
We need to verify that uv supports all Poetry features currently used in DevSynth and understand any differences in behavior or configuration.

## Action Plan
- Install uv and test basic functionality
- Compare dependency resolution behavior
- Test optional extras and group handling
- Evaluate lockfile compatibility
- Assess virtual environment management differences
- Benchmark performance improvements

## Acceptance Criteria
- uv successfully installed on all target platforms (Linux, macOS, CI runners)
- Documentation of uv feature parity with current Poetry usage
- Identification of any incompatibilities or workarounds needed
- Performance benchmark results (dependency resolution, install times)
- Recommendation on uv version and configuration approach

## Progress
- 2025-10-28: Task created
