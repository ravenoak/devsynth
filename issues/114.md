# Issue 114: Requirements wizard failures

Behaviour and integration tests for the requirements wizard (`tests/integration/general/test_requirements_gathering.py` and related behaviour step files) fail due to logging errors and incorrect persistence of the priority value. Update `DevSynthLogger` to handle `exc_info` correctly and verify the gather and wizard flows write expected configuration.

## Progress
- Updated logging to handle `exc_info` correctly and ensured priority persistence.
- `tests/integration/general/test_requirements_gathering.py` passes.
- All tasks complete. Issue closed.
