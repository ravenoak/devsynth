# Issue 109: Improve deployment automation

- Add scripts for environment bootstrapping and health checks
- Integrate Docker image publishing into CI pipeline
- Provide rollback instructions and test coverage
- Enforce non-root execution and strict `.env` permissions in deployment scripts with smoke tests
