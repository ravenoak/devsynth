# Phase 1 completion
Milestone: 0.1.0-beta.1
Status: in progress
Priority: high
Dependencies:

## Problem Statement
Downstream tickets reference Phase 1 completion, but no tracking issue exists to coordinate the milestone.

## Action Plan
- Define deliverables for Phase 1.
- Monitor dependent tickets until all objectives are met.
- Archive this ticket once Phase 1 goals are satisfied.

## Progress
- 2025-02-22: Ticket created to anchor Phase 1 milestone dependencies.
- 2025-09-30: Core workflow and WSDE coordination modules graduated to strict typing; override removed from `pyproject.toml` and regression artefacts captured in `docs/typing/strictness.md` and `diagnostics/mypy_strict_core_agents_memory_20250930T165517Z.txt`.
