Title: DevSynth run-tests missing test_first_metrics file
Date: 2025-09-14 21:35 UTC
Status: closed
Affected Area: tests
Reproduction:
  - `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --report --no-parallel`
  - `poetry run pytest tests/unit/general/test_test_first_metrics.py`
Exit Code: 4
Artifacts:
  - /tmp/full_run.log (empty)
Suspected Cause: Test invocation previously referenced a nonexistent path; corrected to `tests/unit/general/test_test_first_metrics.py`.
Next Actions:
  - [x] Remove stale path reference and ensure test resides under `tests/unit/general/`.
  - [x] Rerun `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --report --no-parallel` after fix and capture coverage artifacts.
Resolution Evidence:
  - [test_reports/test_first_metrics.log](../test_reports/test_first_metrics.log) (previous attempt)
