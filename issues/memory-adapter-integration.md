# Memory Adapter Integration
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.2
Status: in progress
Priority: high
Dependencies: docs/specifications/memory-adapter-integration.md, tests/behavior/features/memory_adapter_integration.feature,
docs/specifications/memory-adapter-read-and-write-operations.md, tests/behavior/features/memory_adapter_read_and_write_operations.feature

## Problem Statement
Memory Adapter Integration, including read and write operations, is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.


## Action Plan
- Review `docs/specifications/memory-adapter-integration.md` and `memory-adapter-read-and-write-operations.md` for requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Add or update BDD tests in `tests/behavior/features/memory_adapter_integration.feature` and `memory_adapter_read_and_write_operations.feature`.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: extracted from dialectical audit backlog.
- 2025-08-24: merged `memory-adapter-read-and-write-operations.md` into this ticket.
- 2025-09-20: Adapter invariants promoted to review with targeted unit+integration coverage (21.57 % for `memory_manager.py`, 15.84 % for `sync_manager.py`), but the read/write feature remains a placeholder and blocks specification promotion until executable steps are supplied.【F:docs/implementation/adapters_invariants.md†L1-L80】【F:issues/tmp_cov_memory_adapters.json†L1-L1】【F:tests/behavior/features/memory_adapter_read_and_write_operations.feature†L1-L25】
- 2025-09-20: Added behavior scenarios and step definitions exercising write-through propagation and missing-key errors, allowing the read/write specification to progress to review status.【F:tests/behavior/features/memory_adapter_read_and_write_operations.feature†L1-L16】【F:tests/behavior/steps/test_memory_adapter_read_and_write_operations_steps.py†L1-L71】【F:docs/specifications/memory-adapter-read-and-write-operations.md†L1-L48】
