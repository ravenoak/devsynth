# Memory Adapter Integration
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.2
Status: in progress
Priority: high
Dependencies: docs/specifications/memory-adapter-integration.md, tests/behavior/features/memory_adapter_integration.feature,
docs/specifications/memory-adapter-read-and-write-operations.md, tests/behavior/features/memory_adapter_read_and_write_operations.feature

## Problem Statement
Memory Adapter Integration, including read and write operations, is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.


## Action Plan
- Review `docs/specifications/memory-adapter-integration.md` and `memory-adapter-read-and-write-operations.md` for requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Add or update BDD tests in `tests/behavior/features/memory_adapter_integration.feature` and `memory_adapter_read_and_write_operations.feature`.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: extracted from dialectical audit backlog.
- 2025-08-24: merged `memory-adapter-read-and-write-operations.md` into this ticket.
