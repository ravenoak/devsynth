# Issue 113: Kuzu memory integration errors
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1

The Kuzu backed memory store fails during test setup:
```
AttributeError: module 'devsynth.config.settings' has no attribute 'kuzu_embedded'
```
Tests affected include `tests/integration/general/test_kuzu_memory_integration.py` and unit adapter tests. Fix the configuration lookup and ensure ephemeral stores initialise correctly.
