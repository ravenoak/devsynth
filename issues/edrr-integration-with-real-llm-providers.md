# EDRR Integration with Real LLM Providers
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.2
Status: in progress
Priority: high
Dependencies: docs/specifications/edrr-integration-with-real-llm-providers.md, tests/behavior/features/edrr_integration_with_real_llm_providers.feature

## Problem Statement
EDRR Integration with Real LLM Providers is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.


## Action Plan
- Review `docs/specifications/edrr-integration-with-real-llm-providers.md` for requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Add or update BDD tests in `tests/behavior/features/edrr_integration_with_real_llm_providers.feature`.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: extracted from dialectical audit backlog.
- 2025-09-20: Provider-system invariants promoted to review with property-based regression evidence and a focused coverage sweep (16.86 % line coverage) captured in `issues/tmp_cov_provider_system.json`; remaining work tracks end-to-end provider wiring once real backends are available.【F:docs/implementation/provider_system_invariants.md†L1-L110】【F:issues/tmp_cov_provider_system.json†L1-L1】
