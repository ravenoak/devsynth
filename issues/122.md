# Issue 122: devsynth run-tests lacks --maxfail option

Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1

Attempting to limit test failures with `--maxfail` results in an error because the DevSynth CLI doesn't accept this option. Without a way to stop early, the `devsynth run-tests` command can run longer than expected during quick feedback loops.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Execute `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --maxfail=1`.
2. Observe the CLI error: `No such option: --maxfail`.

## Suggested improvement
Expose a `--maxfail` flag on `devsynth run-tests` that forwards to `pytest` to allow early termination after a specified number of failures.

## Progress
- Reproduced the error when passing `--maxfail=1` to `devsynth run-tests`.
