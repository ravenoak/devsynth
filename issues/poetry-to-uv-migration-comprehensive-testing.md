# Poetry-to-uv Migration: Comprehensive Testing and Validation
Milestone: 0.2.0-alpha.1
Status: planning
Priority: high
Dependencies: issues/poetry-to-uv-migration-workflows-migration.md

## Problem Statement
We must validate that the uv migration doesn't break any functionality, maintains performance standards, and provides expected improvements.

## Action Plan
- Run full test suite in uv environment
- Compare performance metrics (test execution time, CI duration)
- Validate all optional features and integrations
- Test deployment scenarios
- Compare dependency resolution accuracy
- Run integration tests with external services

## Acceptance Criteria
- All unit, integration, and behavior tests pass
- Performance meets or exceeds Poetry baseline
- All optional features work (LLM providers, vector stores, UIs)
- Deployment processes function correctly
- External integrations remain stable
- CI performance shows expected 3x improvement

## Progress
- 2025-10-28: Task created

## References
- tests/: Full test suite with speed markers
- CI workflows: Performance comparison baseline
- Optional features: chromadb, kuzu, faiss, LM Studio, OpenAI, etc.
- Deployment scripts and configurations
