# DevSynth run-tests hangs
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1
Status: blocked
Priority: high
Dependencies: Resolve-pytest-xdist-assertion-errors.md

## Problem Statement
Executing `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed fast` or `pytest -m fast` hangs without producing output, preventing validation of the test suite. This blocks the release process and undermines confidence in automated testing.

## Action Plan
- Reproduce the hang with `devsynth run-tests` and `pytest` to capture diagnostics.
- Ensure optional providers default to disabled to avoid stalls.
- Investigate subprocess usage in `run_tests` for blocking behavior.
- Add regression tests to confirm `devsynth run-tests` completes and reports results.
- Update documentation on running tests once the issue is resolved.

## Progress
- 2025-08-23: Initial reportâ€”commands hang on fresh environment; `scripts/verify_test_markers.py` completes, indicating tests exist but runner stalls.
- 2025-08-23: After reinstalling the environment, `scripts/install_dev.sh` installed go-task v3.44.1 and `poetry install --with dev --extras "tests retrieval chromadb api"` ran. `task --version` shows 3.44.1 and `poetry run devsynth --help` displays CLI options, but `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast` exits immediately with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'devsynth'`.

- 2025-08-23: Installed missing Typer dependency via `pipx runpip devsynth install typer`; `devsynth --help` now fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jsonschema'`, leaving `devsynth run-tests` unusable.
