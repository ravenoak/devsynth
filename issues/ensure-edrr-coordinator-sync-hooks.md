# Ensure EDRR coordinator sync hooks fire without memory manager
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1
Status: open
Priority: medium
Dependencies: none

## Progress
- Identified that `_sync_memory` returned without notifying hooks when no memory manager was configured.
- Added fallback to emit final sync hook on missing manager or flush failure.
