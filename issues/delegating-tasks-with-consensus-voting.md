# Delegating tasks with consensus voting
Milestone: 0.1.0
Status: closed
Priority: low
Dependencies: Phase-2-completion.md, docs/specifications/delegating-tasks-with-consensus-voting.md, tests/behavior/features/delegating_tasks_with_consensus_voting.feature

## Problem Statement
Delegating tasks with consensus voting is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.


## Action Plan
- Review `docs/specifications/delegating-tasks-with-consensus-voting.md` for requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Add or update BDD tests in `tests/behavior/features/delegating_tasks_with_consensus_voting.feature`.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: extracted from dialectical audit backlog.
- 2025-09-21: Behavior and unit coverage now exercise voting delegation, no-solution fallbacks, and dialectical error handling; specification promoted to review.【F:docs/specifications/delegating-tasks-with-consensus-voting.md†L1-L71】【F:tests/behavior/features/delegating_tasks_with_consensus_voting.feature†L1-L20】【F:tests/behavior/steps/test_delegate_task_consensus_steps.py†L1-L120】
