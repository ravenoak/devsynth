# DeepAgents Adapter Implementation
Milestone: v0.2.0
Status: planned
Priority: medium
Dependencies: deepagents-integration.md, pyproject.toml

## Problem Statement

DevSynth needs a proper adapter layer to integrate LangChain's DeepAgents library while maintaining compatibility with existing agent architecture and hexagonal design principles.

## Action Plan

### DeepAgents Library Integration
- Add `deepagents` dependency to pyproject.toml with appropriate version constraints
- Create DeepAgents adapter in `src/devsynth/adapters/agents/deepagents_adapter.py`
- Implement hexagonal architecture compatibility (ports and adapters pattern)

### Planning Tools Integration
- Extend EDRR coordinator to use DeepAgents `write_todos` tool
- Modify Expand phase to leverage systematic task decomposition
- Add configuration options for planning tool usage

### File System Context Management
- Implement file system tools adapter (`ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`)
- Integrate with existing memory management for context offloading
- Add configurable thresholds for context overflow prevention

### Subagent Coordination
- Implement subagent spawning using DeepAgents task tool
- Integrate with WSDE team coordinator for hierarchical agent management
- Add context isolation and result aggregation capabilities

### Long-term Memory Bridge
- Connect DeepAgents LangGraph Store with DevSynth hybrid memory system
- Ensure cross-session continuity and knowledge preservation
- Implement memory synchronization protocols

## Progress
- ⏳ Add DeepAgents dependency to pyproject.toml
- ⏳ Create DeepAgents adapter following hexagonal architecture
- ⏳ Implement planning tools integration in EDRR coordinator
- ⏳ Add file system context management capabilities
- ⏳ Implement subagent spawning and coordination
- ⏳ Connect long-term memory systems
- ⏳ Add comprehensive test coverage
