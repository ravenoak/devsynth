# Multi-Layered Memory System
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.2
Status: in progress
Priority: high
Dependencies: docs/specifications/multi-layered-memory-system.md, docs/specifications/multi-layered-memory-system-and-tiered-cache-strategy.md, tests/behavior/features/multi_layered_memory_system.feature, tests/behavior/features/multi_layered_memory_system_and_tiered_cache_strategy.feature

## Problem Statement
Multi-Layered Memory System is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.


## Action Plan
- Review `docs/specifications/multi-layered-memory-system.md` for requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Add or update BDD tests in `tests/behavior/features/multi_layered_memory_system.feature`.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: extracted from dialectical audit backlog.
- 2025-02-26: integrated tiered cache into memory adapter and added property tests.
- 2025-08-20: addressed review feedback and refreshed documentation.
- 2025-08-21: consolidated with `multi-layered-memory-system-and-tiered-cache-strategy` ticket.
