# Improve deployment automation
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1
Status: open

Priority: low
Dependencies: None

## Problem Statement
Improve deployment automation is not yet implemented, limiting DevSynth's capabilities.



Current Docker Compose workflows require manual steps.

- Add scripts for environment bootstrapping and health checks
- Integrate Docker image publishing into CI pipeline
- Provide rollback instructions and test coverage
- Enforce non-root execution and strict `.env` permissions in deployment scripts with smoke tests

## Action Plan
- Define the detailed requirements.
- Implement the feature to satisfy the requirements.
- Create appropriate tests to validate behavior.
- Update documentation as needed.

## Progress
- 2025-02-19: no automation scripts added yet.
