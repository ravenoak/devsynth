# Issue 124: Dialectical audit reports missing WebUI Diagnostics Page

Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1

The dialectical audit lists "WebUI Diagnostics Page" as referenced in docs or tests but not in code. However, the WebUI implementation includes a `diagnostics_page` view. The audit may be misconfigured or missing detection logic.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Run `poetry run python scripts/dialectical_audit.py --maxfail=1`.
2. Observe the entry: "Feature 'WebUI Diagnostics Page' is referenced in docs or tests but not in code."
3. Inspect `src/devsynth/interface/webui.py` where `diagnostics_page` is defined.

## Suggested improvement
Update the dialectical audit configuration to recognize the existing diagnostics page or adjust naming so the feature is correctly detected.

## Progress
- Confirmed audit report persists even though `diagnostics_page` is implemented.
