# Restore strict typing for devsynth.testing.*
Milestone: 0.1.0-alpha.1
Status: closed

## Problem Statement
Modules under `devsynth.testing.*` use `ignore_errors=true` in `pyproject.toml`, so tests are unchecked by mypy.

## Action Plan
- [x] Add type annotations to testing utilities.
- [x] Remove the `ignore_errors` override from `pyproject.toml`.
- [x] Update `issues/typing_relaxations_tracking.md` and close this issue.

## Resolution Evidence
- 2025-09-14: `poetry run mypy src/devsynth/testing` reports no errors.
- 2025-09-14: `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast` passes.
