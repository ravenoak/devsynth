"""
Unit Test Template for DevSynth

This template provides a standardized structure for writing unit tests in the DevSynth project.
It follows the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach and best practices.

Usage:
1. Copy this template to the appropriate location in the tests/unit/ directory
2. Rename the file to test_<module_name>.py
3. Replace the placeholder content with your actual tests
4. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for each test
5. Include both positive and negative test cases
6. Ensure tests are hermetic and deterministic
