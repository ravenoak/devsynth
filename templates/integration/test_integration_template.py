"""
Integration Test Template for DevSynth

This template demonstrates the structure and best practices for writing integration tests in DevSynth.
Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly.
Replace the placeholder content with your actual test code.

Usage:
1. Copy this template to the appropriate location in the tests/integration/ directory
2. Rename the file to reflect the components being tested (e.g., test_promise_broker_integration.py)
3. Replace the placeholder content with your actual test code
4. Run the tests using pytest

Best Practices:
- Test the interactions between real components (not mocks)
- Mock external services and dependencies outside the scope of the test
- Use fixtures for complex setup and teardown
- Ensure tests are hermetic (isolated from each other and the external environment)
- Focus on component interactions rather than detailed behavior of individual components
- Use clear, descriptive test names that explain the scenario being tested
