"""
Step Definitions Template for BDD Tests in DevSynth

This template demonstrates how to implement step definitions for BDD tests using pytest-bdd.
Replace the placeholder content with your actual step definitions.

Usage:
1. Copy this template to the appropriate location in the tests/behavior/steps/ directory
2. Rename the file to match the feature being tested (e.g., test_promise_system_steps.py)
3. Replace the placeholder content with your actual step definitions
4. Run the tests using pytest

Best Practices:
- Keep step definitions simple and focused
- Reuse step definitions where appropriate
- Use fixtures for common setup and teardown
- Use context objects to share state between steps
- Write steps from the user's perspective
- Use a ubiquitous language that all stakeholders can understand
