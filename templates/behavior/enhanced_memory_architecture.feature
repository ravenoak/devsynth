Feature: Enhanced Memory and Knowledge Architecture
  As a developer using DevSynth
  I want to use the enhanced memory and knowledge architecture
  So that I can benefit from multi-layered memory, knowledge graphs, and improved storage options

  Background:
    Given the DevSynth system is initialized
    And the enhanced memory system is configured

  Scenario: Multi-layered memory system
    When I store information in the memory system
    Then it should be categorized into appropriate memory layers
    And short-term memory should contain immediate context
    And episodic memory should contain past events
    And semantic memory should contain general knowledge

  Scenario: RDF-based knowledge graph
    When I store structured knowledge in the system
    Then it should be represented as RDF triples in the knowledge graph
    And I should be able to query the knowledge graph using SPARQL
    And the knowledge graph should maintain relationships between entities

  Scenario: Multiple storage backends
    Given the system is configured with multiple storage backends
    When I store information in the memory system
    Then I should be able to specify which backend to use
    And I should be able to retrieve information from any configured backend
    And the system should maintain consistency across backends

  Scenario: TinyDB-backed structured memory
    When I store structured data in the memory system
    Then it should be stored in a TinyDB-backed store
    And I should be able to query the structured data efficiently
    And the structured data should maintain its schema

  Scenario: Unified query interface
    Given the memory system has multiple storage backends
    When I query the memory system
    Then the query should be routed to the appropriate backend
    And I should receive consistent results regardless of the backend
    And the query interface should abstract away backend-specific details

  Scenario: Tiered cache strategy
    When I repeatedly access the same information
    Then frequently accessed items should be stored in the in-memory cache
    And accessing cached items should be faster than accessing non-cached items
    And the cache should be updated based on access patterns
