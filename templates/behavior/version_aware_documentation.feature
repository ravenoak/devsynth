Feature: Version-Aware Documentation Management
  As a developer using DevSynth
  I want to use version-aware documentation management
  So that I can access the correct documentation for specific library versions

  Background:
    Given the DevSynth system is initialized
    And the version-aware documentation system is configured

  Scenario: Documentation ingestion pipeline
    When I provide a manifest of project dependencies with versions
    Then the system should identify documentation sources for each dependency
    And the system should fetch and process the documentation
    And the documentation should be indexed and stored in the system
    And each documentation chunk should be associated with its source and version

  Scenario: Version tagging for documentation chunks
    When documentation is ingested into the system
    Then each chunk should be tagged with its library name and version
    And each chunk should be tagged with its section or topic
    And each chunk should be tagged with its source URL
    And the tags should be queryable for precise retrieval

  Scenario: Offline documentation mode
    Given documentation for project dependencies has been ingested
    When I switch to offline mode
    Then the system should use the cached documentation
    And I should be able to access all previously ingested documentation
    And the system should indicate that it's operating in offline mode

  Scenario: Lazy-loaded documentation mode
    Given the system is configured for lazy-loaded documentation
    When I request information about a library feature
    Then the system should check if relevant documentation is available
    And if not available, it should fetch the documentation on demand
    And the newly fetched documentation should be indexed and stored for future use

  Scenario: Version-specific documentation retrieval
    Given documentation for multiple versions of a library is available
    When I request documentation for a specific version
    Then the system should return only documentation for that version
    And the documentation should be relevant to the requested feature
    And the system should indicate the version of the documentation

  Scenario: Documentation drift detection
    Given documentation for a library has been ingested
    When a new version of the library is released
    Then the system should detect the version change
    And it should compare the new documentation with the existing documentation
    And it should identify significant changes or drift
    And it should update the documentation index accordingly

  Scenario: Query engine for version-specific documentation
    When I query for documentation on a specific feature
    Then the system should consider the project's dependency versions
    And it should prioritize documentation matching those versions
    And it should return the most relevant documentation chunks
    And the results should include version information for each chunk
