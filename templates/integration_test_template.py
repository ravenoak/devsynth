"""
Integration Test Template for DevSynth

This template provides a standardized structure for writing integration tests in the DevSynth project.
It follows the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach and best practices for integration testing.

Integration tests verify that different components of the system work together correctly.
They focus on the interactions between components rather than the internal details of each component.

Usage:
1. Copy this template to the appropriate location in the tests/integration/ directory
2. Rename the file to test_<feature_name>.py
3. Replace the placeholder content with your actual tests
4. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for each test
5. Include both positive and negative test cases
6. Ensure tests are hermetic and deterministic
