# DevSynth Phase 2 Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for Phase 2 of the DevSynth project, building upon the progress made in Phase 1. Based on a thorough analysis of the current codebase, this plan addresses both the remaining tasks from Phase 1 and introduces new Phase 2 objectives as outlined in the original RELEASE_PLAN.md.

The assessment reveals that while significant progress has been made on core components (EDRR framework at 85%, WSDE multi-agent workflows at 70%, UXBridge abstraction at 75%, and configuration at 90%), there are still gaps to address before fully transitioning to Phase 2. Test coverage is particularly low at approximately 20-21%, indicating a need for improved testing across all components.

This plan employs a multi-disciplinary approach driven by dialectical reasoning to ensure a robust implementation that meets all requirements while maintaining high code quality and comprehensive test coverage.
