# Phase 1 Completion Summary

Phase 1 focused on **Foundation Stabilization**. Key accomplishments include:

- Completed a comprehensive implementation audit and alignment effort.
- Performed an in-depth assessment of the EDRR framework and identified integration gaps.
- Validated the WSDE model with gap analysis and prepared integration plans.
- Established a secure multi-stage Docker build and local development environment.
- Implemented environment-specific configuration validation and deployment documentation.
- Integrated the Anthropic provider with streaming completions.
- Added a deterministic offline provider enabling repeatable text and embeddings.

With these objectives achieved, the project established a solid baseline for subsequent phases.
