# Feature Dependencies

This document summarizes how major DevSynth features depend on one another. Understanding these relationships helps plan releases in a logical order. For each feature's implementation status, consult the [Feature Status Matrix](../implementation/feature_status_matrix.md).

| Feature | Depends On | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Providers | Core configuration, offline mode | Foundation for all LLM interactions. Needed before memory backends can generate embeddings. |
| Memory backends | Providers | Vector stores require embeddings from a provider. Stable provider APIs must be available first. |
| Multi-language support | Providers, Memory backends | Requires reliable provider completions and memory storage for multi-language code. Introduced after memory is stable. |
| DSPy integration | Providers, Memory backends, Multi-language support | DSPy relies on consistent provider interfaces and memory persistence. Planned for later releases once multi-language features are in place. |

These dependencies influence the sequence of upcoming releases. Providers and memory backends are addressed in early versions, followed by multi-language features and eventually DSPy integration.
## Implementation Status

This feature is **implemented**.
