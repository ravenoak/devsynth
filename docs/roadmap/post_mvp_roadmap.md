# DevSynth Post-MVP Development Roadmap

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the roadmap for DevSynth development beyond the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It focuses on features that would enhance DevSynth's capabilities, allow it to operate on its own codebase, and enable continuous self-improvement. The roadmap is organized into phases, with each phase building upon the previous one to create a more powerful and versatile development tool.

## 2. Vision for Post-MVP DevSynth

The post-MVP vision for DevSynth is to create a self-improving development tool that can:

1. **Analyze and understand its own codebase**
2. **Generate improvements to its own functionality**
3. **Implement advanced multi-agent collaboration**
4. **Provide comprehensive code analysis and refactoring**
5. **Integrate seamlessly with existing development workflows**
6. **Learn from user feedback and adapt to user preferences**
7. **Operate efficiently with minimal resource usage**


## 3. Development Phases

   - Hierarchical representation of project structure


#### Implementation Strategy:

1. Develop a code analysis module that can parse Python code
2. Implement a project indexing system for efficient code navigation
3. Enhance the memory system to store and retrieve code insights
4. Create visualization tools for architecture and dependencies


### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework

**Objective**: Implement a flexible multi-agent system for complex tasks.

#### Features:

1. **Specialized Agents**
   - Architecture Agent for high-level design
   - Code Agent for implementation
   - Test Agent for test generation
   - Documentation Agent for documentation
   - Refactoring Agent for code improvement

2. **Agent Collaboration Protocol**
   - Message passing between agents
   - Task delegation and coordination
   - Conflict resolution mechanisms
   - Shared context and memory

3. **Agent Orchestration**
   - Dynamic agent selection based on task
   - Parallel execution of compatible tasks
   - Sequential execution of dependent tasks
   - Monitoring and coordination of agent activities


#### Implementation Strategy:

1. Define interfaces for agent communication
2. Implement specialized agents with focused capabilities
3. Develop orchestration mechanisms for agent coordination
4. Create shared memory and context systems for collaboration


### Phase 3: Self-Improvement Capabilities

**Objective**: Enable DevSynth to generate improvements to its own functionality.

#### Features:

1. **Self-Modification Framework**
   - Safe code generation for self-modification
   - Validation of generated modifications
   - Rollback mechanisms for failed modifications
   - Incremental improvement tracking

2. **Learning from Usage Patterns**
   - Usage pattern analysis
   - Performance optimization based on usage
   - Adaptation to user preferences
   - Continuous improvement of prompts and templates

3. **Feedback Integration System**
   - Collection of explicit user feedback
   - Analysis of implicit feedback (accepted/rejected suggestions)
   - Adjustment of behavior based on feedback
   - Personalization of interactions


#### Implementation Strategy:

1. Implement a sandboxed environment for testing self-modifications
2. Develop validation mechanisms for generated code
3. Create a feedback collection and analysis system
4. Implement learning algorithms for continuous improvement


### Phase 4: Advanced Code Generation and Refactoring

**Objective**: Enhance code generation and refactoring capabilities.

#### Features:

1. **Advanced Code Generation**
   - Context-aware code completion
   - Intelligent code suggestions
   - Implementation of design patterns
   - Generation of boilerplate code

2. **Code Refactoring**
   - Identification of code smells
   - Automated refactoring suggestions
   - Performance optimization
   - Code style enforcement

3. **Architecture Evolution**

## 4. Feature Details

### 4.1 Self-Analysis System

The Self-Analysis System will enable DevSynth to understand its own codebase and generate improvements. Key components include:

#### Code Parser and Analyzer

```python
class CodeAnalyzer:
    """Analyzes Python code to extract structure and insights."""

    def analyze_file(self, file_path: str) -> CodeAnalysis:
        """Analyze a single Python file."""
        pass

    def analyze_directory(self, dir_path: str) -> ProjectAnalysis:
        """Analyze a directory of Python files."""
        pass

    def generate_dependency_graph(self) -> DependencyGraph:
        """Generate a dependency graph of the analyzed code."""
        pass

    def identify_code_smells(self) -> List[CodeSmell]:
        """Identify potential code smells in the analyzed code."""
        pass
```

#### Project Indexer

```python
class ProjectIndexer:
    """Indexes a project for efficient navigation and retrieval."""

    def index_project(self, project_path: str) -> ProjectIndex:
        """Index a project directory."""
        pass

    def search_code(self, query: str) -> List[CodeMatch]:
        """Search for code matching the query."""
        pass

    def find_references(self, symbol: str) -> List[SymbolReference]:
        """Find all references to a symbol in the codebase."""
        pass
