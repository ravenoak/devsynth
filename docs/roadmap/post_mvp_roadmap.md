class CodeAnalyzer:
    """Analyzes Python code to extract structure and insights."""

    def analyze_file(self, file_path: str) -> CodeAnalysis:
        """Analyze a single Python file."""
        pass

    def analyze_directory(self, dir_path: str) -> ProjectAnalysis:
        """Analyze a directory of Python files."""
        pass

    def generate_dependency_graph(self) -> DependencyGraph:
        """Generate a dependency graph of the analyzed code."""
        pass

    def identify_code_smells(self) -> List[CodeSmell]:
        """Identify potential code smells in the analyzed code."""
        pass
```

## 5. Testing Strategy

To maintain reliability, DevSynth will adopt a multi-layered testing approach:

- **Unit Testing** for individual modules.
- **Integration Testing** for component interactions.
- **Behavior Testing** for end-to-end scenarios.
- **Property-Based Testing** with generated inputs.
- **Self-Testing** using DevSynth's own capabilities.

## 6. Documentation Strategy

Comprehensive documentation ensures accessibility for all stakeholders.

- **User Documentation** such as tutorials and guides.
- **API Documentation** for developers.
- **Architecture Documentation** detailing internal design.
- **Developer Guides** for contributors.
- **Self-Documenting Features** that generate docs from code.

## Conclusion

These additions outline how DevSynth will evolve after its MVP release. By implementing collaboration, self-improvement, and integration features alongside rigorous testing and documentation, the project can continually enhance its capabilities and serve a broad range of development workflows.
