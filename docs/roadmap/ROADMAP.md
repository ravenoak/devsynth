# DevSynth Roadmap

**Note:** DevSynth is currently in a pre-release stage. Refer to the [Release Plan](release_plan.md) for canonical milestones.

This document provides a simplified overview of upcoming release milestones. For
full details, see the [Release Plan](release_plan.md). Current feature progress
is summarized in the [Feature Status Matrix](../implementation/feature_status_matrix.md).

- **Pre-0.1.0** – Internal iterations and prototype development. No package is published yet.
- **0.1.x** – Early previews focusing on stabilization and the Worker Self-Directed Enterprise model.
- **0.2.0** – Expanded agent capabilities, improved memory backends, and API enhancements.
- **1.0.0** – First stable release with documentation, test coverage, and deployment automation.

## Current Release Status

DevSynth is preparing the **0.1.0-alpha.1** milestone which finalizes the core architecture,
adds offline provider support, and delivers baseline CLI commands. The subsequent
**0.1.0-beta.1** release will introduce the peer review workflow and a Web UI preview, followed
by **0.1.0-rc.1** once the full test suite passes. Detailed implementation progress for these
milestones is available in the [Feature Status Matrix](../implementation/feature_status_matrix.md).

## Implementation Status

This feature is **implemented**.
