# DevSynth Development Status

**Note:** DevSynth is in a pre-release state. Current versions are numbered
`0.1.x` and do not represent a stable release.

This document serves as the single source of truth for the current development status of the DevSynth project. It consolidates information from various summary documents and provides a clear overview of implementation progress across all phases. Major milestones are tracked in the [Release Plan](release_plan.md).

## Provider Completion Summary

The provider subsystem now supports both Anthropic's API and a deterministic
offline provider. The Anthropic provider integrates with the existing provider
abstraction and allows streaming completions. The offline provider enables
repeatable text and embedding generation when `offline_mode` is enabled,
ensuring CLI and WebUI features work without network access.

## Completed Tasks (as of 2025-07-10)

- **Anthropic Provider Integration**: Added full support for Anthropic's API with
  streaming completions.
- **Offline Provider Implementation**: Created deterministic provider for
  repeatable text and embedding generation when `offline_mode` is enabled.
- **Feature Implementation Audit**: Documented current implementation status and
  limitations.
- **EDRR Framework Assessment**: Produced detailed integration plan for the
  recursive EDRR framework.
- **WSDE Model Validation**: Established integration roadmap after validating
  collaboration gaps.

## Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization

## Phase 4: Repository Structure Cleanup

### Completed Tasks

1. **Directory Organization**:
   - Reorganized repository structure for clarity
   - Removed the symlink `.devsynth/project.yaml` in the root directory
   - Ensured no `.devsynth/` directory is created for projects not managed by DevSynth
   - Updated code to use `.devsynth/project.yaml` as the project configuration file

2. **Manifest File Enhancement**:
   - Updated manifest schema and documentation
   - Changed the manifest location from the root directory to `.devsynth/project.yaml`
   - Updated the `load_manifest` function to handle the case when the project is not managed by DevSynth
   - Updated the `validate_manifest` function to skip validation for projects not managed by DevSynth
   - Updated the `ingest_cmd` function to handle the case when the project is not managed by DevSynth

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated documentation to reflect the new repository structure
   - Updated README.md to clarify that the presence of a `.devsynth/` directory is the marker that a project is managed by DevSynth
   - Updated docs/developer_guides/devsynth_configuration.md to reflect the new location and purpose of the project configuration file
   - Added a new best practice to emphasize that the `.devsynth/` directory should not be created manually


## Phase 5: Verification and Validation

### Completed Tasks

1. **Test Verification**:
   - Ran all tests to verify functionality
   - Identified and fixed several import errors and missing modules
   - Added missing exception classes to support tests
   - Most tests now run successfully, with only a few failures related to specific functionality that needs further attention

   - Documentation is accurate and up-to-date

5. **Traceability Verification**:
   - Reviewed the requirements traceability matrix
   - Confirmed that all requirements have corresponding code modules and tests
   - Verified that the status of each requirement is accurately reflected
   - Complete bidirectional traceability between requirements, code, and tests

6. **Final Report**:
   - Created [PHASE_5_COMPLETION_SUMMARY](PHASE_5_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md) to document the completion of Phase 5
   - Documented key achievements and lessons learned
   - Provided recommendations for future maintenance
7. **Metrics Commands Implemented**:
   - Added `alignment_metrics` and `test_metrics` CLI commands
   - Commands generate alignment and test-first development reports


## Maintenance Strategy

To prevent future divergence between documentation, code, and tests:

1. **Documentation Review Process**: Implement a regular review cycle for all documentation
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Add documentation validation to CI/CD pipeline
3. **Traceability Enforcement**: Require updates to requirements traceability matrix for all changes
4. **BDD-First Development**: Enforce updating feature files before implementing new functionality


## Next Steps

All phases of the DevSynth Repository Harmonization Plan have been successfully completed. The repository is now more congruent, comprehensive, detailed, correct, and coherent. The immediate next steps are to:

1. **Address Remaining Test Failures**: Fix the remaining test failures identified during Phase 5, particularly those related to the MemoryType enum and other specific functionality.

2. **Implement Maintenance Strategy**: Begin implementing the maintenance strategy outlined above to prevent future divergence between documentation, code, and tests.

3. **Continue Feature Development**: With a solid foundation in place, continue developing new features according to the project roadmap, following the established best practices for documentation, testing, and code organization.
