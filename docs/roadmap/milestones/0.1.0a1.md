# Milestone 0.1.0a1

Purpose: Align in-repo tickets and the stabilization plan toward the 0.1.0a1 pre-release. This document maps prioritized tickets and checklist items from docs/tasks.md to clear exit criteria.

References:
- project guidelines (style, typing, testing discipline)
- docs/plan.md (stabilization priorities)
- docs/tasks.md (authoritative checklist)
- docs/release/release_readiness.md (gates)

## Scope and Priorities
- Stabilization of fast/medium test suites; slow suite must be reliable and properly guarded.
- Docs build must be green.
- CI workflows must pass lint, typing, security checks.

## Mapping to docs/tasks.md
- Testing stability: tasks 5–15, 31–36 (progressive hardening across smoke/normal/xdist, isolation, cache invalidation tests).
- Coverage and quality: tasks 23, 25–27 (coverage ratchet, mypy strict verification, style/hygiene, security triage).
- CI and behavior: tasks 35–36 (xdist friendliness, behavior tests sans third‑party plugins in smoke).
- Governance and planning: tasks 71–72 (ticket audit and milestone alignment). This document satisfies task 72’s planning artifact.

## Ticket Alignment (issues/)
- Use issues/README.md owners/labels schema for each ticket.
- Ensure each active ticket includes:
  - Milestone: 0.1.0a1
  - Owner: <name or @handle>
  - Labels: one or more from schema (area/test/infra/docs/security)
  - Links: docs/tasks.md item numbers (e.g., Task 5, Task 23)
  - Acceptance Criteria: concrete, testable; reference speed marker categories where applicable.

## Exit Criteria
- All tests pass on CI: fast (PR), medium (nightly), slow (pre‑release) — see .github/workflows/ci-tests.yml.
- Docs build succeeds on CI — see docs build workflow.
- Typing (mypy), style (black/isort/flake8), and security (bandit/safety) jobs are green — see .github/workflows/*.
- Known flakes list (docs/testing/known_flakes.md) contains no blockers for 0.1.0a1.
- README and CLI help reflect version 0.1.0a1; packaging sanity verified per docs/tasks.md Task 74.

## How to Update
- When a ticket is completed, update issues/<slug>.md Status and, if closed, move to issues/archived/.
- Reflect meaningful completions by checking corresponding items in docs/tasks.md and, if warranted, adding a brief rationale to docs/rationales/test_fixes.md (thesis/antithesis/synthesis).
