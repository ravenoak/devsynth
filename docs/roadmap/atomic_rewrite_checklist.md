# Atomic-Rewrite Baseline Integration Checklist

This checklist enumerates concrete tickets required to plan and track the Atomic-Rewrite baseline integration. It complements docs/roadmap/release_plan.md and aligns with docs/plan.md guiding principles.

## Milestones
- M1: Spike and Architecture Alignment
- M2: Adapter and Port Definitions
- M3: Minimal Vertical Slice (CLI path)
- M4: Test Coverage and Stability
- M5: Documentation and Developer Experience

## Ticket Checklist
- [ ] AR-1: Draft Atomic-Rewrite architecture notes and interfaces (ports) under docs/architecture/atomic_rewrite.md
- [ ] AR-2: Define integration boundaries with existing EDRR flows (diagram + sequence)
- [ ] AR-3: Introduce feature flag DEVSYNTH_FEATURE_ATOMIC_REWRITE and default to off
- [ ] AR-4: Create stub adapter skeleton in src/devsynth/adapters/atomic_rewrite/ (no external side effects)
- [ ] AR-5: Add application orchestration glue with clean error-path fallbacks
- [ ] AR-6: Provide BDD scenarios covering opt-in flow and graceful disable
- [ ] AR-7: Add unit tests for feature flag gating and stub execution path
- [ ] AR-8: Extend CLI help and reference docs listing experimental flag
- [ ] AR-9: Ensure logging and sanitization conform to policy
- [ ] AR-10: CI gating: ensure feature flag disabled in default CI runs

## Notes
- Follow project guidelines (SDD, TDD, BDD; clarity; maintainability).
- Keep offline-first and deterministic behavior for tests; use local mocks/stubs only.
- Tickets should reference ReqIDs where applicable and link to test coverage.
