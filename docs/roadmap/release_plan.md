# DevSynth Release Plan

This document consolidates the various roadmap drafts into a single authoritative plan. It outlines the major phases leading to a stable 1.0 release and summarizes key version milestones.
DevSynth is still pre-0.1.0 and no official release has been published yet. Version references in this plan are provisional and will follow our [Semantic Versioning Guidelines](../policies/semantic_versioning.md).

## Phased Roadmap

1. **Foundation Stabilization** (0.1.x – Q1 2025)
   - Finalize core architecture (EDRR, WSDE, providers, memory).
   - Address adoption barriers and ensure offline capabilities.
   - Establish baseline testing and documentation.

2. **Production Readiness** (0.2.x–0.3.x – Q2 2025)
   - Polish CLI UX and integrate the initial Web UI.
   - Perform repository analysis and improve code organization.
   - Expand automated testing and CI/CD.

3. **Collaboration & Validation** (0.4.x–0.6.x – Q3–Q4 2025)
   - Enhance multi-agent collaboration features.
   - Validate workflows with real-world projects and community feedback.
   - Iterate on metrics, analytics, and documentation quality.

4. **Full Release & Innovation** (0.7.x–1.0.0 – 2026)
   - Harden security and performance for production deployments.
   - Complete Web UI and API features.
   - Finalize documentation and publish the 1.0 release.
   - Plan post-1.0 innovations and enterprise capabilities.

### Version Milestones

- **0.1.0-alpha / beta / rc**: Foundation stabilization and feature completion.
- **0.2.0–0.6.0**: Incremental releases adding collaboration, Web UI, and testing improvements.
- **0.7.0–0.9.0**: Optimization and preparation for the 1.0 release.
- **1.0.0**: Stable release with comprehensive documentation and production readiness.

This plan supersedes the individual phase tables previously scattered across multiple documents. All future roadmap updates should occur here.
