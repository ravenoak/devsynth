# DevSynth Repository Harmonization Final Summary

**Note:** DevSynth is still in a pre-release stage. The final release plan is tracked in [release_plan.md](release_plan.md). Current feature completion levels are listed in the [Feature Status Matrix](../implementation/feature_status_matrix.md).

All phases of the DevSynth Repository Harmonization Plan are complete. The project now features cohesive documentation, validated tests, and a streamlined repository structure. Key achievements include full Anthropic provider integration and a deterministic offline mode. Remaining work focuses on minor test failures, implementing a maintenance strategy, and continuing feature development according to the roadmap.
## Implementation Status

This feature is **implemented**.
