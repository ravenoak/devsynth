# DevSynth Roadmap

**Note:** DevSynth has not reached an official release yet. The roadmap
documents progress toward a future stable version while current builds remain in
the `0.1.x` pre-release series.

This section outlines the future plans and development trajectory for the DevSynth project. For
current implementation progress, see the [Feature Status Matrix](../implementation/feature_status_matrix.md).

## Development Plans

- **[Consolidated Roadmap](CONSOLIDATED_ROADMAP.md)**: The canonical source for all roadmap information, consolidating previously separate roadmap documents into a single authoritative plan with development methodology.
- **[Release Plan](release_plan.md)**: Version milestones for upcoming releases.
- **[Development Status](development_status.md)**: The current status of development efforts.
- **[Post-MVP Roadmap](post_mvp_roadmap.md)**: Details the features and enhancements planned after the Minimum Viable Product stage.
- **[Release Automation Workflow](release_automation.md)**: Describes the CI pipeline for tagging and publishing releases.
- **[Feature Dependencies](feature_dependencies.md)**: Summarizes how major DevSynth features depend on one another.
- **[Maintenance Policy](../policies/maintenance.md)**: Defines the maintenance strategy and review process.

### Archived Roadmap Documents

Historical roadmap documents have been consolidated into the Consolidated Roadmap above. Archived versions are available in [`../archived/roadmaps/`](../archived/roadmaps/) for reference.

## Documentation and Testing Plans

- **[Documentation Policies](../policies/documentation_policies.md)**: Policies and guidelines for maintaining high-quality documentation in the project.
- **[Testing Infrastructure Plan](../specifications/testing_infrastructure.md)**: Plans for enhancing the testing infrastructure and processes.

## Strategic Vision

- **[Executive Summary](../analysis/executive_summary.md)**: A high-level summary of the project's strategic direction and goals.

## Overview
