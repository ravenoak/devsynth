- Outdated or incorrect examples should be updated or removed

## Versioning

- Clearly mark documentation that applies to specific versions
- Maintain a changelog for major documentation updates

## Style Guide

- Follow the [Code Style Guide](../developer_guides/code_style.md) for code examples
- Use consistent formatting and structure in all documentation

## Audits

- Conduct regular documentation audits to identify outdated or missing content
- Schedule audits at least once per release cycle

## Templates

- Use documentation templates for new guides, references, and policies

## Cross-Linking
