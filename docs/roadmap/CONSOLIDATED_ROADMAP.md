# DevSynth Consolidated Roadmap

This document serves as the canonical source for all roadmap information, consolidating the previously separate roadmap documents into a single authoritative plan. It outlines the major phases leading to a stable 1.0 release and summarizes key version milestones.

**Note:** DevSynth is currently in a pre-release stage. No official release has been published yet and versions in this plan are provisional. They follow the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-STABILITY notation defined in our [Semantic Versioning+ policy](../policies/semantic_versioning.md).

## Current Status

As of August 25, 2025, the project is finalizing Phase 1 (Foundation Stabilization) with `0.1.0-alpha.1` as the current target. Achievements to date include:

- **Test Stabilization**:
  - Fixed pytest import issues in multiple test files
  - Fixed method signature issues in test classes
  - Fixed indentation issues in test files
  - Fixed syntax errors in behavior test files
  - Applied fixes for flaky tests in high-priority modules
  - Applied recommended fixes to improve test isolation
  - Improved marker coverage from 40.22% to 58.9% (exceeding the 50% target)

- **Documentation**:
  - Updated documentation tracking in docs/DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_PROGRESS.md
  - Documented lessons learned and best practices in flaky_test_lessons.md
  - Created test stabilization tools and scripts

- **Methodology Integration**:
  - Extended sprint adapter to cover all EDRR phase hooks
  - Added behavior tests for the sprint EDRR cycle

The project will transition to Phase 2 (Production Readiness) after publishing `0.1.0-alpha.1`.

## Development Methodology

### Strategic Framework

#### Guiding Principles

1. **Truth-seeking over comfort**: Prioritize accurate assessment of implementation status over maintaining comfortable illusions
2. **User value over feature quantity**: Focus on completing core features that deliver immediate value
3. **Stability over novelty**: Establish reliable foundations before pursuing advanced capabilities
4. **Measurable progress over activity**: Define concrete success metrics for all initiatives
5. **Balanced perspectives**: Integrate technical, operational, user, and business considerations

#### Dialectical Approach

Each major initiative employs a dialectical reasoning process:

1. **Thesis**: Initial proposed approach based on primary objectives
2. **Antithesis**: Consideration of alternative perspectives and potential drawbacks
3. **Synthesis**: Balanced solution that incorporates multiple viewpoints and mitigates risks

#### Workflow Steps

The development workflow for each sprint follows these steps:

1. **Sprint Planning Alignment** – Map upcoming work to the appropriate EDRR phase so planning outputs feed the Expand phase
2. **Phase Execution** – Carry out the Expand, Differentiate, Refine and Retrospect phases to process and refine artifacts
3. **Retrospective Review** – Summarize outcomes, capture lessons learned and feed action items into the next planning cycle

## Phased Roadmap

#### Phase 2 Timeline

1. **Preparation (Weeks 1-2)**:
   - Review requirements and create detailed implementation plan
   - Set up infrastructure and establish metrics
   - Prioritize work items and assign responsibilities

2. **Implementation (Weeks 3-10)**:
   - Web UI Integration and State Management (Weeks 3-5)
   - Repository Analysis and Code Organization (Weeks 4-7)
   - Automated Testing and CI/CD Expansion (Weeks 5-8)
   - Multi-language Code Generation (Weeks 6-9)
   - AST Mutation Tooling (Weeks 7-10)

3. **Verification and Finalization (Weeks 11-12)**:
   - Comprehensive testing and validation
   - Documentation and reporting
   - Preparation for Phase 3

### 3. Collaboration & Validation (0.4.x–0.6.x – Q1–Q3 2026) - PLANNED

- Enhance multi-agent collaboration features
- Validate workflows with real-world projects and community feedback
- Iterate on metrics, analytics, and documentation quality
- Integrate the experimental DSPy-AI framework in **0.6.x**

### 4. Full Release & Innovation (0.7.x–1.0.0 – Q4 2026) - PLANNED

- Harden security and performance for production deployments
- Complete Web UI and API features
- Finalize documentation and publish the 1.0 release

## Implementation Details

### UXBridge & Hexagonal Layers

All interfaces (CLI, WebUI, Agent API) use the common **UXBridge** abstraction. This confirms the hexagonal architecture: core workflows are UI-agnostic and testable.

### Configuration & Requirements

DevSynth requires Python 3.12+ support and provides configuration through `pyproject.toml`, `.devsynth/project.yaml` schema, and default config.

### Optional Vector Stores

DevSynth supports alternative memory stores like **ChromaDB** in addition to Kuzu, FAISS, and LMDB. The configuration loader recognizes `memory_backend: chromadb` and `docker-compose.yml` ships with a sample `chromadb` service.

### WSDE Model

The **WSDETeam** and **WSDETeamCoordinator** support rotating primus, consensus voting, and dialectical hooks. The peer review mechanism is implemented, but the full workflow still needs completion.

### DSL & EDRR Integration

The EDRRCoordinator orchestrates expand/differentiate/refine cycles. The `edrr-cycle` command allows stepping through phases.

## Current Test Summary

Recent metrics identify **5,842** tests across the suite—**3,884** unit, **1,184** integration, **656** behavior, **82** performance, and **36** property. A focused fast run of the requirements wizard scenario produced **0** failing tests, **1** passing test, and **14** skipped tests with **14%** coverage. See the [development status](development_status.md#test-failure-summary) document for details.

To publish `0.1.0-alpha.1`, the project must:

- Run `poetry run task release:prep` to generate release artifacts
- Run `poetry run python scripts/dialectical_audit.py` and resolve any findings from the audit log
- Resolve the outstanding WebUI and EDRR coordinator test failures
- Complete WSDE collaboration integration with the memory system and finalize the peer review workflow
- Address remaining partial features listed in the [Feature Status Matrix](../implementation/feature_status_matrix.md) such as Methodology Integration and the Retry Mechanism
- Continue documentation cleanup and polish the Web UI preview

Current builds run with `features.wsde_collaboration` enabled but `features.dialectical_reasoning` disabled. Collaborative and dialectical reasoning features are still experimental and may fail in complex projects.

## Remaining Issues

While Phase 1 is nearing completion, there are some remaining issues that should be monitored before moving to Phase 2:

1. **API Change Issues**: Some tests are failing due to API changes in the codebase. These should be addressed as part of the normal development process in Phase 2.

2. **Comprehensive Test Runs**: Full test suite runs still show some failures. These should be addressed incrementally during Phase 2 as part of the continuous improvement process.

3. **Test Stabilization Tools Documentation**: Usage documentation for the test stabilization tools should be completed early in Phase 2.

## Dependencies

Dependencies among major features are summarized in [Feature Dependencies](feature_dependencies.md) to clarify how releases build on each other. For a detailed breakdown of feature implementation progress, see the [Feature Status Matrix](../implementation/feature_status_matrix.md).
