# DevSynth Testing Strategy

## Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy for DevSynth, providing guidelines for writing effective tests and ensuring comprehensive test coverage. DevSynth follows a multi-layered testing approach that combines unit tests, integration tests, and behavior-driven development (BDD) tests to ensure the quality and reliability of the codebase.

## Testing Philosophy

DevSynth's testing philosophy is based on the following principles:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementing features to ensure that the code meets the requirements.
2. **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Use BDD to define the behavior of the system from the user's perspective.
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage across all layers of the application.
4. **Isolation**: Test components in isolation to identify issues more easily.
5. **Automation**: Automate tests to ensure they can be run consistently and frequently.
6. **Maintainability**: Write tests that are easy to understand and maintain.


## Test Types

DevSynth uses several types of tests, each serving a different purpose:

### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify that individual components (functions, classes, methods) work correctly in isolation. They focus on testing a single unit of code with all dependencies mocked or stubbed.

**Location**: `tests/unit/`

**Framework**: pytest

**Naming Convention**: Files should be named `test_*.py` and test functions should be named `test_*`.

**Example**:

```python

# tests/unit/test_ux_bridge.py

import pytest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock, patch

from devsynth.interface.ux_bridge import UXBridge, sanitize_output

class TestUXBridge:
    """Tests for the UXBridge abstract base class."""
    
    def test_sanitize_output(self):
        """Test that sanitize_output properly escapes HTML."""
        # Test with HTML content
        html = "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"
        sanitized = sanitize_output(html)
        assert sanitized == "&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;"
        
        # Test with None
        assert sanitize_output(None) == ""
        
        # Test with non-string
        assert sanitize_output(123) == "123"
```

## Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly. They test the interaction between multiple units, often involving real dependencies.

**Location**: `tests/integration/`

**Framework**: pytest

**Naming Convention**: Files should be named `test_*.py` and test functions should be named `test_*`.

**Example**:

```python

# tests/integration/test_cli_webui_parity.py

import pytest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock, patch

from devsynth.interface.cli import CLIUXBridge
from devsynth.interface.webui import WebUI

def test_display_result_parity():
    """Test that CLI and WebUI display results consistently."""
    cli_bridge = CLIUXBridge()
    webui_bridge = WebUI()
    
    # Mock the output methods
    cli_output = []
    webui_output = []
    
    with patch("rich.console.Console.print", lambda self, msg, **kwargs: cli_output.append(str(msg))):
        with patch("streamlit.write", lambda msg, **kwargs: webui_output.append(str(msg))):
            # Test with simple message
            cli_bridge.display_result("Test message")
            webui_bridge.display_result("Test message")
            
            # Test with HTML content
            cli_bridge.display_result("<script>alert('XSS')</script>")
            webui_bridge.display_result("<script>alert('XSS')</script>")
    
    # Verify that both bridges produce the same output
    assert cli_output == webui_output
```

## Behavior Tests (BDD)

Behavior tests verify that the system behaves as expected from the user's perspective. They are written in a natural language format (Gherkin) and focus on the behavior of the system rather than its implementation.

**Location**: `tests/behavior/`

**Framework**: pytest-bdd

**Structure**:

- Feature files: `tests/behavior/features/*.feature`
- Step definitions: `tests/behavior/steps/*.py`
- Test files: `tests/behavior/test_*.py`


**Example**:

```gherkin

# tests/behavior/features/cli_ux_enhancements.feature

Feature: CLI UX Enhancements
  As a developer
  I want an improved CLI experience
  So that I can work more efficiently with DevSynth

  Scenario: CLI shows enhanced progress indicators
    Given the CLI is initialized
    When I run a long-running operation
    Then I should see an enhanced progress indicator
    And the progress indicator should show estimated time remaining
    And the progress indicator should show subtasks
```

```python

# tests/behavior/steps/cli_ux_steps.py

import pytest
from pytest_bdd import given, when, then, parsers
from unittest.mock import MagicMock, patch

from devsynth.interface.cli import CLIUXBridge

@pytest.fixture
def cli_context():
    """Set up the CLI context."""
    bridge = CLIUXBridge()
    return {"bridge": bridge, "progress": None}

@given("the CLI is initialized")
def cli_initialized(cli_context):
    """Initialize the CLI."""
    return cli_context

@when("I run a long-running operation")
def run_long_operation(cli_context):
    """Run a long-running operation."""
    with patch("rich.progress.Progress.start") as mock_start:
        with patch("rich.progress.Progress.add_task") as mock_add_task:
            progress = cli_context["bridge"].create_progress("Long-running operation", total=100)
            cli_context["progress"] = progress

@then("I should see an enhanced progress indicator")
def check_progress_indicator(cli_context):
    """Check that the progress indicator is displayed."""
    assert cli_context["progress"] is not None

@then("the progress indicator should show estimated time remaining")
def check_time_remaining(cli_context):
    """Check that the progress indicator shows estimated time remaining."""
    # Implementation depends on the specific progress indicator
    pass

@then("the progress indicator should show subtasks")
def check_subtasks(cli_context):
    """Check that the progress indicator shows subtasks."""
    progress = cli_context["progress"]
    subtask_id = progress.add_subtask("Subtask", total=10)
    assert subtask_id is not None
```

```python

# tests/behavior/test_cli_ux_enhancements.py

from pytest_bdd import scenarios

from .steps.cli_ux_steps import *  # noqa: F401,F403

scenarios("cli_ux_enhancements.feature")
```

## Test Coverage

DevSynth aims for high test coverage across all layers of the application. The target coverage is:

- **Unit Tests**: ≥90% line coverage for core modules
- **Integration Tests**: ≥80% line coverage for integration points
- **Behavior Tests**: Cover all user-facing features and workflows


Coverage is measured using the pytest-cov plugin and can be checked with:

```bash
python -m pytest --cov=devsynth
```

## Test Isolation

Tests should be isolated from each other to prevent interference. This means:

1. **No Shared State**: Tests should not depend on the state created by other tests.
2. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks or stubs for external dependencies.
3. **Clean Up After Tests**: Use fixtures with proper teardown to clean up any resources created during tests.


## Test Fixtures

DevSynth uses pytest fixtures extensively to set up test environments and provide test data. Fixtures should be:

1. **Reusable**: Create fixtures that can be reused across multiple tests.
2. **Isolated**: Fixtures should not interfere with each other.
3. **Scoped Appropriately**: Use the appropriate scope (function, class, module, session) for fixtures.


**Example**:

```python

# tests/conftest.py

import pytest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock

@pytest.fixture
def mock_llm_provider():
    """Provide a mock Provider for testing."""
    provider = MagicMock()
    provider.generate.return_value = "Generated text"
    return provider

@pytest.fixture
def temp_project_dir(tmp_path):
    """Create a temporary project directory for testing."""
    project_dir = tmp_path / "test_project"
    project_dir.mkdir()
    (project_dir / ".devsynth").mkdir()
    (project_dir / ".devsynth" / "project.yaml").write_text("name: test_project\n")
    return project_dir
```

## Mocking

DevSynth uses the `unittest.mock` library for mocking external dependencies. When mocking:

1. **Mock at the Right Level**: Mock at the boundary of the system under test.
2. **Don't Mock What You Don't Own**: Prefer to mock your own code rather than third-party libraries.
3. **Verify Interactions**: Use `assert_called_with` to verify that mocks are called with the expected arguments.


**Example**:

```python

# tests/unit/test_llm_provider.py

import pytest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock, patch

from devsynth.adapters.llm.openai_provider import OpenAIProvider

def test_openai_provider_generate():
    """Test that the OpenAI provider generates text correctly."""
    # Mock the OpenAI API
    with patch("openai.ChatCompletion.create") as mock_create:
        # Set up the mock response
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.choices[0].message.content = "Generated text"
        mock_create.return_value = mock_response
        
        # Create the provider and generate text
        provider = OpenAIProvider(api_key="test_key")
        result = provider.generate("Test prompt")
        
        # Verify the result
        assert result == "Generated text"
        
        # Verify the API was called with the expected arguments
        mock_create.assert_called_once()
        args, kwargs = mock_create.call_args
        assert kwargs["messages"][0]["content"] == "Test prompt"
```

## Parameterized Tests

Use parameterized tests to test multiple inputs with the same test function. This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to add new test cases.

**Example**:

```python

# tests/unit/test_sanitize_output.py

import pytest
from devsynth.interface.ux_bridge import sanitize_output

@pytest.mark.parametrize("input_text,expected_output", [
    ("<script>alert('XSS')</script>", "&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;"),
    (None, ""),
    (123, "123"),
    ("Normal text", "Normal text"),
])
def test_sanitize_output(input_text, expected_output):
    """Test that sanitize_output handles various inputs correctly."""
    assert sanitize_output(input_text) == expected_output
```

## Test Data

DevSynth uses several approaches for test data:

1. **Fixtures**: Use pytest fixtures to provide test data.
2. **Factory Functions**: Create factory functions that generate test data.
3. **Faker**: Use the Faker library to generate realistic test data.


**Example**:

```python

# tests/unit/test_requirement.py

import pytest
from faker import Faker

from devsynth.domain.models.requirement import Requirement, RequirementType, RequirementPriority

# Create a Faker instance

fake = Faker()

def create_requirement(
    title=None,
    description=None,
    type=None,
    priority=None,
    constraints=None
):
    """Factory function to create a Requirement with default values."""
    return Requirement(
        title=title or fake.sentence(),
        description=description or fake.paragraph(),
        type=type or RequirementType.FUNCTIONAL,
        priority=priority or RequirementPriority.MEDIUM,
        constraints=constraints or fake.paragraph(),
    )

def test_requirement_creation():
    """Test that a Requirement can be created with default values."""
    requirement = create_requirement()
    assert requirement.title is not None
    assert requirement.description is not None
    assert requirement.type == RequirementType.FUNCTIONAL
    assert requirement.priority == RequirementPriority.MEDIUM
    assert requirement.constraints is not None

def test_requirement_with_custom_values():
    """Test that a Requirement can be created with custom values."""
    requirement = create_requirement(
        title="Custom Title",
        description="Custom Description",
        type=RequirementType.NON_FUNCTIONAL,
        priority=RequirementPriority.HIGH,
        constraints="Custom Constraints",
    )
    assert requirement.title == "Custom Title"
    assert requirement.description == "Custom Description"
    assert requirement.type == RequirementType.NON_FUNCTIONAL
    assert requirement.priority == RequirementPriority.HIGH
    assert requirement.constraints == "Custom Constraints"
```

## Test Organization

DevSynth organizes tests to mirror the structure of the source code:

```text
tests/
├── unit/                  # Unit tests
│   ├── adapters/          # Tests for adapters
│   ├── application/       # Tests for application logic
│   ├── domain/            # Tests for domain models
│   └── ...
├── integration/           # Integration tests
│   ├── adapters/          # Tests for adapter integration
│   ├── application/       # Tests for application integration
│   └── ...
├── behavior/              # Behavior tests
│   ├── features/          # Feature files
│   ├── steps/             # Step definitions
│   └── ...
└── conftest.py            # Shared fixtures
```

## Continuous Integration

DevSynth uses continuous integration (CI) to run tests automatically on every commit. The CI pipeline:

1. **Runs All Tests**: Runs unit, integration, and behavior tests.
2. **Checks Coverage**: Ensures that test coverage meets the targets.
3. **Runs Linting**: Ensures that code follows the style guidelines.
4. **Builds Documentation**: Ensures that documentation builds correctly.


## Best Practices

When writing tests for DevSynth, follow these best practices:

1. **Write Tests First**: Follow TDD by writing tests before implementing features.
2. **Keep Tests Simple**: Each test should test one thing and be easy to understand.
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive names for test functions and variables.
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error cases.
5. **Don't Test Implementation Details**: Test behavior, not implementation details.
6. **Avoid Test Interdependence**: Tests should not depend on each other.
7. **Clean Up After Tests**: Use fixtures with proper teardown to clean up resources.
8. **Use Assertions Effectively**: Use specific assertions that provide helpful error messages.
9. **Document Tests**: Add docstrings to test functions to explain what they test.
10. **Keep Tests Fast**: Tests should run quickly to provide fast feedback.


## Conclusion

DevSynth's testing strategy combines unit tests, integration tests, and behavior tests to ensure the quality and reliability of the codebase. By following this strategy and the best practices outlined in this document, developers can contribute high-quality, well-tested code to the DevSynth project.
