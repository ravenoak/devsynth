# DevSynth Maintenance Strategy

This guide describes the ongoing processes required to keep DevSynth's documentation, code, and tests aligned. It implements the maintenance strategy defined in the project roadmap and policies.

## 1. Documentation Review Cycle

- Perform a full review of all documentation every **two weeks**.
- Use the checklists from [Documentation Review Process](../policies/documentation_review_process.md) to ensure consistency.
- Record review notes in `docs/DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_PROGRESS.md`.
- Update diagrams and metadata as needed.

## 2. CI Documentation Checks

- The CI pipeline automatically validates documentation style and links.
- Run `pre-commit run --files <file>` before pushing changes to trigger the same checks locally.
- CI must pass on all pull requests. Fix any warnings or broken links reported by `mkdocs build` and lint jobs.

## 3. Traceability Updates

- For every feature or bug fix, update the [Requirements Traceability Matrix](../requirements_traceability.md).
- Cross reference new or modified tests with their corresponding requirements IDs.
- Pull requests should include these updates in the same commit as the code change.

## 4. BDDâ€‘First Development

- Update feature files under `tests/behavior/` before implementing functionality.
- Ensure scenarios reflect any new requirements and reference them in the traceability matrix.
- Commit the updated feature files and traceability changes together.

## Implementation Status

This strategy is **implemented** and enforced via code review and CI.
