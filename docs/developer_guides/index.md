## Overview

The Developer Guides section provides comprehensive documentation for developers working on the DevSynth project. Whether you're a new contributor or an experienced developer, these guides will help you understand the project's architecture, coding standards, testing approach, and development processes.

The guides are organized into several categories:

- **Core Development Guides**: Essential information for getting started with development, including setup instructions, contribution guidelines, and code style.
- **Testing Guides**: Detailed information about the testing approach, best practices, and specific testing techniques used in DevSynth.
- **Configuration and System Guides**: Information about configuring DevSynth and understanding its core systems.
- **Process Guides**: Documentation about development processes and practices.

## Getting Started

If you're new to DevSynth development, we recommend starting with the [Onboarding Guide](onboarding.md), followed by the [Development Setup](development_setup.md) guide to set up your environment. Then, review the [Contributing Guide](contributing.md) to understand how to contribute to the project.
