## Overview

DevSynth has a large test suite with over 2,700 tests across various categories. Running all tests can be time-consuming, so we've implemented several tools and strategies to make test execution more efficient:

1. **Test Categorization**: Tests are categorized by speed (fast, medium, slow) to allow running only tests of a certain speed.
2. **Test Prioritization**: Tests are prioritized based on risk factors to focus on tests that are more likely to fail.
3. **Parallel Execution**: Tests can be run in parallel across multiple processes for faster execution.
4. **Incremental Testing**: Only tests affected by recent changes can be run to save time.
5. **Distributed Execution**: Tests can be distributed across multiple processes with load balancing.

## Test Infrastructure

The DevSynth test infrastructure consists of several components:

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: Located in `tests/unit/`, these test individual components in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Located in `tests/integration/`, these test interactions between components.
- **Behavior Tests**: Located in `tests/behavior/`, these use Gherkin syntax to define features and scenarios.
- **Performance Tests**: Located in `tests/performance/`, these test performance characteristics.
- **Property Tests**: Located in `tests/property/`, these use hypothesis testing to verify properties.

### Speed Categories

Tests are categorized by speed to allow for more efficient test execution:

- **Fast Tests**: Execute in less than 1 second. Ideal for running frequently during development.
- **Medium Tests**: Execute between 1-5 seconds. Provide a good balance between coverage and execution time.
- **Slow Tests**: Execute in more than 5 seconds. Typically integration or behavior tests that involve multiple components.

### Test Scripts

The following scripts are available for test execution:

- **devsynth run-pipeline**: Runs tests by category and speed.
- **enhanced_test_categorization.py**: Categorizes tests by speed based on execution time.
- **prioritize_high_risk_tests.py**: Identifies and runs high-risk tests based on multiple factors.
- **reconcile_test_counts.py**: Reconciles test counts across different sources.
- **distributed_test_runner_enhanced.py**: Runs tests in parallel with load balancing.
- **fix_test_markers.py**: Fixes marker placement issues in test files.
- **common_test_collector.py**: Provides a unified interface for collecting tests.

## Test Categorization

### Understanding Test Speed Categories

Tests are categorized by speed to allow for more efficient test execution:

- **Fast Tests** (`@pytest.mark.fast`): Execute in less than 1 second.
- **Medium Tests** (`@pytest.mark.medium`): Execute between 1-5 seconds.
- **Slow Tests** (`@pytest.mark.slow`): Execute in more than 5 seconds.

### Categorizing Tests

You can categorize tests using the `enhanced_test_categorization.py` script:

```bash
# Categorize tests in a specific module
python scripts/enhanced_test_categorization.py --module tests/unit/application/cli --update

# Categorize tests with priority for high-priority modules
python scripts/enhanced_test_categorization.py --priority --update

# Limit the number of tests categorized in a single run
python scripts/enhanced_test_categorization.py --max-tests 50 --update

# Generate a categorization report
python scripts/enhanced_test_categorization.py --report --update

# Fix marker placement issues after categorization
python scripts/enhanced_test_categorization.py --fix-markers --update
```

### Checking Test Categorization Status

You can check the current categorization status using the `common_test_collector.py` script:

```bash
# Get test counts by category
python scripts/common_test_collector.py --count

# Get marker counts
python scripts/common_test_collector.py --marker-counts

# List tests with a specific marker
python scripts/common_test_collector.py --list-marked-tests --marker-type medium
```

### Reconciling Test Counts

If you notice discrepancies in test counts across different sources, you can use the `reconcile_test_counts.py` script:

```bash
# Analyze discrepancies without making changes
python scripts/reconcile_test_counts.py --analyze

# Update documentation files with accurate counts
python scripts/reconcile_test_counts.py --update-docs

# Update tracking files with accurate counts
python scripts/reconcile_test_counts.py --update-tracking

# Update both documentation and tracking files
python scripts/reconcile_test_counts.py --update-all
```

## Test Prioritization

### Understanding Risk Factors

The `prioritize_high_risk_tests.py` script identifies high-risk tests based on multiple factors:

1. **Historical Failure Rates**: Tests that failed recently are more likely to fail again.
2. **Code Complexity**: More complex tests are more likely to fail.
3. **Recent Changes**: Tests affected by recent code changes are more likely to fail.
4. **Dependencies**: Tests that depend on components with high failure rates are more likely to fail.

### Running High-Risk Tests

You can run high-risk tests using the `prioritize_high_risk_tests.py` script:

```bash
# Run high-risk tests in a specific module
python scripts/prioritize_high_risk_tests.py --module tests/unit/application/cli

# Run only the top 50 highest-risk tests
python scripts/prioritize_high_risk_tests.py --limit 50

# Run tests with a minimum risk score of 70
python scripts/prioritize_high_risk_tests.py --min-risk 70

# Update test history with new results
python scripts/prioritize_high_risk_tests.py --update-history

# Generate a detailed risk report
python scripts/prioritize_high_risk_tests.py --report

# Show tests that would be run without running them
python scripts/prioritize_high_risk_tests.py --dry-run
```

### Interpreting Risk Reports

The risk report generated by `prioritize_high_risk_tests.py` includes:

- **Overall Risk Score**: A score from 0-100 indicating the overall risk of a test.
- **Risk Factors**: Individual risk factors (failure history, code complexity, recent changes, dependencies).
- **Test Results**: Whether the test passed or failed and its execution time.
- **Summary Statistics**: Total tests, high/medium/low risk tests, pass rate.

## Efficient Test Execution

### Running Tests by Category and Speed

You can run tests by category and speed using the `devsynth run-pipeline` command:

```bash
# Run all tests
devsynth run-pipeline

# Run only unit tests
devsynth run-pipeline --unit

# Run only fast tests
devsynth run-pipeline --fast

# Run only unit tests that are fast
devsynth run-pipeline --unit --fast

# Run tests with segmentation for better performance
devsynth run-pipeline --segment
```

### Parallel Test Execution

You can run tests in parallel using the `distributed_test_runner_enhanced.py` script:

```bash
# Run tests in parallel with 4 processes
python scripts/distributed_test_runner_enhanced.py --workers 4

# Run only unit tests in parallel
python scripts/distributed_test_runner_enhanced.py --category unit

# Run only fast tests in parallel
python scripts/distributed_test_runner_enhanced.py --speed fast

# Run tests with balanced load distribution
python scripts/distributed_test_runner_enhanced.py --balance-load

# Generate an HTML report
python scripts/distributed_test_runner_enhanced.py --html
```

### Running Modified Tests

You can run only tests affected by recent changes using the `run_modified_tests.py` script:

```bash
# Run tests affected by changes in the last commit
python scripts/run_modified_tests.py

# Run tests affected by changes in the last 5 commits
python scripts/run_modified_tests.py --since HEAD~5

# Run tests affected by changes in a specific file
python scripts/run_modified_tests.py --file src/devsynth/application/cli/commands/init_cmd.py
```

### Balanced Test Distribution

You can distribute tests across processes with balanced load using the `run_balanced_tests.py` script:

```bash
# Run tests with balanced load distribution across 4 processes
python scripts/run_balanced_tests.py --processes 4

# Run only unit tests with balanced load distribution
python scripts/run_balanced_tests.py --category unit

# Use historical execution times for load balancing
python scripts/run_balanced_tests.py --use-history
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tests take too long to run**:
   - Use `--fast` to run only fast tests
   - Enable segmentation with `--segment`
   - Run only specific test types with `--unit`, `--integration`, or `--behavior`
   - Use the distributed test runner: `python scripts/distributed_test_runner_enhanced.py`

2. **Memory issues**:
   - Use segmentation with `--segment` to run tests in smaller batches
   - Reduce the segment size with `--segment-size`
   - Run tests in parallel with `--processes`

3. **Test categorization issues**:
   - Run the `enhanced_test_categorization.py` script with `--update` to apply speed markers
   - Use `--force` to recategorize tests regardless of previous categorization
   - Check for marker placement issues with `fix_test_markers.py --report`
   - Fix marker placement issues with `fix_test_markers.py --fix-all`

4. **Markers not being detected**:
   - Check for blank lines between markers and functions
   - Check for markers inside function bodies
   - Verify pytest is imported at the top of the file
   - Run `fix_test_markers.py --fix-all` to fix marker placement issues
   - Clear the cache with `common_test_collector.py --clear-cache`

5. **Inconsistent test counts**:
   - Use `common_test_collector.py --count --no-cache` for accurate counts
   - Check for duplicate test names across different files
   - Verify all test files are being collected
   - Run `reconcile_test_counts.py --analyze` to identify discrepancies

### Fixing Marker Placement Issues

If you encounter issues with marker placement, you can use the `fix_test_markers.py` script:

```bash
# Generate a report of marker issues
python scripts/fix_test_markers.py --report

# Fix misaligned markers in a specific module
python scripts/fix_test_markers.py --module tests/unit/interface

# Fix all marker issues (misaligned, duplicate, inconsistent)
python scripts/fix_test_markers.py --fix-all

# Show detailed information about changes
python scripts/fix_test_markers.py --verbose

# Show changes without modifying files
python scripts/fix_test_markers.py --dry-run
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests with Speed in Mind

1. **Keep tests focused**: Each test should test one specific behavior or functionality.
2. **Minimize setup and teardown**: Use fixtures to share setup and teardown code.
3. **Avoid unnecessary I/O**: Mock external dependencies to avoid network or file system operations.
4. **Use appropriate speed markers**: Categorize tests based on their execution time.
5. **Isolate tests**: Ensure tests don't depend on the state from other tests.

### Adding Speed Markers Manually

You can add speed markers manually to your tests:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.fast
def test_fast_operation():
    # This test should complete in less than 1 second
    assert 1 + 1 == 2

@pytest.mark.medium
def test_medium_operation():
    # This test should complete in 1-5 seconds
    assert 2 + 2 == 4

@pytest.mark.slow
def test_slow_operation():
    # This test might take more than 5 seconds
    assert 3 + 3 == 6
```

### Optimizing Test Speed

1. **Use mocks**: Mock external dependencies to avoid network or file system operations.
2. **Optimize setup and teardown**: Use fixtures to share setup and teardown code.
3. **Use parameterized tests**: Use pytest's parameterize feature to run multiple test cases with a single test function.
4. **Avoid unnecessary assertions**: Only assert what's necessary for the test.
5. **Use appropriate isolation**: Use the `@pytest.mark.isolation` marker for tests that need to be run in isolation.

### Continuous Integration

For continuous integration, we recommend the following approach:

1. **Fast Tests**: Run on every commit to provide quick feedback.
2. **Medium Tests**: Run on pull requests to catch more issues before merging.
3. **Slow Tests**: Run nightly to ensure comprehensive coverage without slowing down development.
4. **High-Risk Tests**: Run on pull requests that modify critical components.

### Test Execution Strategy

For local development, we recommend the following approach:

1. **During Development**:
   - Run fast tests frequently to get quick feedback
   - Use `devsynth run-pipeline --fast`

2. **Before Committing**:
   - Run fast and medium tests to catch more issues
   - Use `devsynth run-pipeline --fast --medium`

3. **Before Pull Request**:
   - Run all tests to ensure comprehensive coverage
   - Use `devsynth run-pipeline`

4. **After Making Changes**:
   - Run tests affected by your changes
   - Use `python scripts/run_modified_tests.py`

5. **When Investigating Failures**:
   - Run high-risk tests to focus on likely failures
   - Use `python scripts/prioritize_high_risk_tests.py`
