# DevSynth Test Suite Overview

This document provides an overview of the DevSynth test suite, including test counts, categories, and current status.

## Test Count Summary

As of August 1, 2025, the DevSynth test suite consists of **5,842 total tests** across various categories and speed classifications.

### Breakdown by Category

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Behavior | 656 | Tests for behavior components |
| Integration | 1,184 | Tests for integration components |
| Performance | 82 | Tests for performance components |
| Property | 36 | Tests for property components |
| Unit | 3,884 | Tests for unit components |
| **Total** | **5,842** | |

### Breakdown by Speed

| Speed | Count | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Fast | 0 | Tests that execute in less than 1 second |
| Medium | 426 | Tests that execute between 1-5 seconds |
| Slow | 1 | Tests that execute in more than 5 seconds |
| Unmarked | 5,415 | Tests that have not yet been categorized by speed |
| **Total** | **5,842** | |

> **Note**: We have begun applying speed categorization to the tests using the `incremental_test_categorization.py` script and the test categorization schedule. So far, we have categorized 318 tests (11.4% of total), including all tests in the `tests/unit/interface` directory and high-priority modules like `tests/unit/application/cli`, `tests/unit/adapters/memory`, `tests/unit/adapters/llm`, `tests/integration/memory`, and `tests/unit/application/wsde`. All categorized tests so far have been marked as "medium" (execution time between 1-5 seconds). We will continue to categorize tests in other directories incrementally according to the [Test Categorization Guide](test_categorization_guide.md).

### Test Status

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Passing | 2,446 | 87.5% |
| Failing | 348 | 12.5% |
| **Total** | **2,794** | **100%** |

> **Note**: The actual failure rate may be higher in specific areas of the codebase. For example, our analysis of the `tests/unit/interface` directory showed a 58.6% failure rate (156 out of 266 tests failing).

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation. They are typically fast and do not depend on external resources.

**Location**: `tests/unit/`

**Count**: 1,728 tests

**Examples**:
- `test_config_loader.py`: Tests for configuration loading functionality
- `test_memory_store.py`: Tests for memory storage components
- `test_llm_provider.py`: Tests for LLM provider integration

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify the interaction between multiple components. They ensure that different parts of the system work together correctly.

**Location**: `tests/integration/`

**Count**: 265 tests

**Examples**:
- `test_cli_commands.py`: Tests for CLI command execution
- `test_memory_integration.py`: Tests for memory system integration
- `test_llm_chain.py`: Tests for LLM chain execution

### Behavior Tests

Behavior tests use Gherkin syntax to define features and scenarios. They focus on testing the behavior of the system from a user's perspective.

**Location**: `tests/behavior/`

**Count**: 799 tests

**Examples**:
- `cli_commands.feature`: Tests for CLI command behavior
- `webui_wizards.feature`: Tests for WebUI wizard behavior
- `edrr_cycle.feature`: Tests for EDRR cycle execution

### Property Tests

Property tests use hypothesis to verify properties of functions. They generate random inputs to test that certain properties hold true for all inputs.

**Location**: `tests/property/`

**Count**: 2 tests

**Examples**:
- `test_memory_properties.py`: Tests for memory system properties
- `test_config_properties.py`: Tests for configuration system properties

## Speed Categories

Tests are categorized by speed to allow for more efficient test execution:

### Fast Tests

Fast tests execute in less than 1 second. They are ideal for running frequently during development.

**Count**: 0 tests (target: ~40% of all tests)

**How to run**: `devsynth run-pipeline --fast`

### Medium Tests

Medium tests execute between 1-5 seconds. They provide a good balance between coverage and execution time.

**Count**: 318 tests (target: ~40% of all tests)

**How to run**: `devsynth run-pipeline --medium`

### Slow Tests

Slow tests execute in more than 5 seconds. They are typically integration or behavior tests that involve multiple components.

**Count**: 0 tests (target: ~20% of all tests)

**How to run**: `devsynth run-pipeline --slow`

### Unmarked Tests

Unmarked tests have not yet been categorized by speed. They need to be analyzed and marked with the appropriate speed category.

**Count**: 2,417 tests

> **Note**: We are in the process of categorizing tests by speed using the new `incremental_test_categorization.py` script, which allows tests to be categorized in smaller batches over time.

## Test Failures

Currently, there are **348 failing tests** out of 2,794 total tests (12.5%). These failures are being addressed as part of the Phase 1 Foundation Stabilization effort.

> **Note**: The actual failure rate may vary across different parts of the codebase. For example, our analysis of the `tests/unit/interface` directory showed a 58.6% failure rate (156 out of 266 tests failing).

### Common Failure Categories

1. **Memory Integration Issues**: Tests that fail due to cross-store memory synchronization issues
2. **WebUI State Persistence**: Tests that fail due to issues with WebUI wizard state persistence
3. **WSDE Peer Review Workflow**: Tests that fail due to incomplete workflow implementation
4. **Mocking Issues**: Tests that fail due to issues with mocking NiceGUI and properly simulating UI interactions

## Running Tests

For detailed information on how to run tests efficiently, see the [Efficient Testing Guide](efficient_testing.md).

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Run all tests
devsynth run-pipeline

# Run only unit tests
devsynth run-pipeline --unit

# Run only fast tests
devsynth run-pipeline --fast

# Run only unit tests that are fast
devsynth run-pipeline --unit --fast

# Run tests with segmentation for better performance
devsynth run-pipeline --segment
```

## Test Metrics

Test metrics are collected and reported using the `devsynth test-metrics` command. This command provides comprehensive information about the test suite, including test counts, failing tests, and coverage metrics.

```bash
# Generate a basic metrics report
devsynth test-metrics

# Generate an HTML report
devsynth test-metrics --html

# Run tests to identify failures
devsynth test-metrics --run-tests
```

The metrics report is saved to `test_metrics_report.json` by default.

## Continuous Integration

Tests are run automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline is configured to:

1. Run fast tests on every commit
2. Run all tests on pull requests
3. Generate test reports for review

## Future Improvements

The following improvements are planned for the test suite:

1. **Complete Test Categorization**: Categorize all unmarked tests by speed
2. **Fix Failing Tests**: Address the 348 failing tests
3. **Improve Test Performance**: Further optimize test execution time
4. **Enhance Test Coverage**: Increase test coverage for critical components
5. **Standardize BDD Tests**: Ensure consistent approach to BDD test implementation
