# Security Audit Guide

Use the security audit command to validate required security settings and run
static analysis and dependency checks.

## Running the Audit

```bash
DEVSYNTH_PRE_DEPLOY_APPROVED=true poetry run python scripts/security_audit.py --report audit.json
```

The command performs the following routines:

- verifies mandatory security flags
- runs Bandit static analysis
- runs Safety dependency scanning
- writes a JSON summary to the path provided by `--report`

The JSON file contains `bandit` and `safety` fields with values `passed`,
`failed`, or `skipped`.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all required environment variables are set before running the audit.
- A non-zero exit code indicates a failed check; inspect the report for details.
