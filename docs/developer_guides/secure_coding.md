# Secure Coding Guidelines

## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for secure coding practices in the DevSynth project. It aims to establish consistent security standards across all components and reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth

Implement multiple layers of security controls:
- **Input Validation**: Validate all input at every trust boundary
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Verify identity and permissions for all operations
- **Secure Defaults**: Start with the most secure configuration by default
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum necessary permissions

### 2. Secure by Design

Security should be built into the design from the beginning:
- **Threat Modeling**: Identify potential threats during design
- **Security Requirements**: Include security requirements in specifications
- **Security Testing**: Plan for security testing from the start
- **Code Reviews**: Include security considerations in code reviews

### 3. Fail Securely

When failures occur, they should not compromise security:
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain security even in degraded states
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Default Deny**: Deny access by default, only allow explicitly permitted actions
- **Rollback**: Be able to safely roll back to a secure state

### 4. Keep It Simple

Simple designs are easier to secure:
- **Minimize Attack Surface**: Reduce the amount of code exposed to untrusted inputs
- **Clear Architecture**: Use a clear, well-documented architecture
- **Avoid Complexity**: Complex systems are harder to secure
- **Standard Patterns**: Use established security patterns rather than inventing new ones

## Language-Specific Guidelines (Python)

### Input Validation

Always validate and sanitize input:

```python

# GOOD: Validate input type and range

def process_count(count_str):
    try:
        count = int(count_str)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValidationError("Count must be an integer")
    
    if count < 1 or count > 100:
        raise ValidationError("Count must be between 1 and 100")
    
    return count

# BAD: No validation

def process_count_bad(count_str):
    return int(count_str)  # Could raise exception or allow negative values
```

## SQL Injection Prevention

Use parameterized queries or ORM:

```python

# GOOD: Using parameters

def get_user(db, user_id):
    cursor = db.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))
    return cursor.fetchone()

# BAD: String concatenation

def get_user_bad(db, user_id):
    cursor = db.cursor()
    cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")  # VULNERABLE!
    return cursor.fetchone()
```

## Command Injection Prevention

Avoid shell commands when possible. If necessary, use subprocess with arguments as a list:

```python

# GOOD: Using subprocess with arguments as a list

import subprocess

def run_command(command_args):
    result = subprocess.run(command_args, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
    return result.stdout

# BAD: Using shell=True or string concatenation

def run_command_bad(command_str):
    result = subprocess.run(command_str, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)  # VULNERABLE!
    return result.stdout
```

## Secure Password Handling

Use proper password hashing:

```python

# GOOD: Using a proper password hashing library

import argon2

def hash_password(password):
    ph = argon2.PasswordHasher()
    return ph.hash(password)

def verify_password(stored_hash, password):
    ph = argon2.PasswordHasher()
    try:
        ph.verify(stored_hash, password)
        return True
    except argon2.exceptions.VerifyMismatchError:
        return False

# BAD: Using weak hashing or no hashing

import hashlib

def hash_password_bad(password):
    return hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()  # VULNERABLE!
```

## Secure File Operations

Validate file paths and avoid path traversal:

```python

# GOOD: Validate and sanitize file paths

import os
from pathlib import Path

def read_file(base_dir, filename):
    # Ensure the filename doesn't contain path traversal
    safe_path = Path(base_dir) / Path(filename).name  # Only use the filename part
    
    # Verify the path is within the allowed directory
    if not safe_path.resolve().is_relative_to(Path(base_dir).resolve()):
        raise SecurityError("Invalid file path")
    
    with open(safe_path, 'r') as f:
        return f.read()

# BAD: Not validating file paths

def read_file_bad(base_dir, filename):
    with open(os.path.join(base_dir, filename), 'r') as f:  # VULNERABLE!
        return f.read()
```

## Security in DevSynth Components

### Promise System Security

The Promise System should enforce strict authorization:

- Ensure the `IPromiseAuthority` implementation follows the principle of least privilege
- Validate all promise parameters before processing
- Implement proper authorization checks for all promise operations
- Audit promise chains for security implications

### API Security

For all API endpoints:

- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate all input parameters
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Set appropriate security headers

### Security Utilities

DevSynth includes helper modules for common security tasks:

- `security.authentication` provides Argon2-based password hashing and simple authentication helpers.
- `security.authorization` offers role-based access control checks.
- `security.sanitization` contains input sanitization utilities.

Use these modules when implementing features that require authentication, authorization, or input validation.

### Dependency Management

For managing dependencies:

- Regularly update dependencies to include security patches
- Use tools like `safety` or `snyk` to check for vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions to prevent unexpected changes
- Review new dependencies for security implications before adding them

## Security Testing

### Unit Tests for Security

Write specific tests for security properties:

```python
def test_password_hashing():
    password = "secure_password"
    hashed = hash_password(password)
    
    # Test that hashing is not reversible
    assert password not in hashed
    
    # Test that verification works
    assert verify_password(hashed, password)
    
    # Test that wrong passwords fail
    assert not verify_password(hashed, "wrong_password")
```

### Fuzz Testing

Implement fuzz testing for input validation:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input_value", [
    "",
    "a" * 1000,
    "!@#$%^&*()",
    "<script>alert('XSS')</script>",
    "'; DROP TABLE users; --",
    "../../../etc/passwd",
])
def test_input_validation_fuzz(input_value):
    with pytest.raises(ValidationError):
        validate_username(input_value)
```

## Detailed Examples for DevSynth Components

Below are secure coding examples for several DevSynth modules.

### Configuration Storage

Ensure configuration files are read from trusted locations and that
values are validated:

```python
from pathlib import Path

def load_project_config(base_dir: Path) -> dict:
    config_path = base_dir / ".devsynth" / "project.yaml"
    if not config_path.is_file():
        raise FileNotFoundError("project.yaml missing")
    with config_path.open("r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        data = yaml.safe_load(f)
    # Validate required fields before use
    validate_project_schema(data)
    return data
```

### Template Rendering

Use the Jinja2 sandboxed environment to render templates safely and
avoid executing arbitrary code from user input.

```python
from jinja2.sandbox import SandboxedEnvironment

env = SandboxedEnvironment(autoescape=True)
template = env.from_string(user_template)
result = template.render(context)
```

### Security Considerations for Specific DevSynth Features

- **Promise System**: Verify every promise with an explicit authority
  check and audit chains for privilege escalation.
- **Agent Execution**: Run agents with the least privileges necessary
  and log their actions for future review.
- **Configuration Storage**: Encrypt sensitive values (such as API
  tokens) at rest and restrict file permissions to the owner.

## Secure Deployment Guidelines

Follow these practices when deploying DevSynth:

- Store secrets in a dedicated secret manager and never commit them to
  source control.
- Enable TLS for all network communication, including internal APIs.
- Use container images with minimal packages and apply security updates
  regularly.
- Configure infrastructure-as-code with immutable builds to prevent
  drift and unauthorized changes.
- Run automated vulnerability scanning and linting in the CI pipeline.

## Incident Response Procedures

In the event of a suspected security incident:

1. **Identify and Contain**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further
   damage while gathering preliminary evidence.
2. **Notify the Team**: Inform project maintainers and, when
   appropriate, stakeholders or users.
3. **Analyze**: Review logs, recent commits, and configuration changes
   to determine the root cause.
4. **Remediate**: Apply patches or configuration changes and redeploy.
5. **Document and Review**: Record the timeline of events and lessons
   learned to improve future response.

## Security Training Requirements

DevSynth contributors should maintain a strong security mindset:

- Complete a security onboarding session before committing code.
- Participate in annual refresher training covering common
  vulnerabilities and new DevSynth features.
- Review the secure coding guidelines regularly and reference the
  OWASP Top Ten in code reviews.
- Document completion of training in the project records.
