# TDD/BDD Integration with EDRR Methodology

## 1. Overview

This document outlines how Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) methodologies integrate with DevSynth's "Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect" (EDRR) process. By aligning these test-first approaches with the EDRR phases, we create a comprehensive framework that ensures quality, maintainability, and alignment with user needs throughout the development lifecycle.

> **Note**: This document describes one approach to integrating TDD/BDD with EDRR. For information on other methodology integrations, see the [Methodology Integration Framework](../technical_reference/methodology_integration_framework.md).

## 2. Core Principles of Integration

1. **Test-First Development**: Tests are written before implementation in all EDRR phases
2. **Multi-Level Testing**: Different types of tests (BDD, integration, unit) are applied at appropriate phases
3. **Continuous Validation**: Tests serve as executable specifications that validate progress
4. **Dialectical Reasoning**: Multiple testing perspectives provide a comprehensive view of the system
5. **Living Documentation**: Tests and scenarios serve as up-to-date documentation


## 3. TDD/BDD-EDRR Structural Mapping

### 3.1 Expand Phase and TDD/BDD

During the Expand phase, we gather all available information and requirements. TDD/BDD integration focuses on:

- **BDD Scenario Creation**: Writing high-level scenarios that capture user requirements
- **Acceptance Criteria Definition**: Establishing clear, testable acceptance criteria
- **Test Scope Identification**: Determining what needs to be tested at all levels
- **Test Data Requirements**: Identifying necessary test data and fixtures


**Implementation Actions:**

- Create feature files with scenarios that describe desired behavior
- Define step definitions that map to the scenarios
- Establish a test plan that covers all aspects of the feature
- Set up test data and environment requirements


### 3.2 Differentiate Phase and TDD/BDD

The Differentiate phase validates requirements against each other and identifies inconsistencies. TDD/BDD integration focuses on:

- **Test Case Refinement**: Enhancing test cases with edge cases and error conditions
- **Test Prioritization**: Determining critical test paths and high-risk areas
- **Test Independence**: Ensuring tests are hermetic and don't interfere with each other
- **Test Coverage Analysis**: Identifying gaps in test coverage


**Implementation Actions:**

- Refine BDD scenarios with scenario outlines for multiple variations
- Create unit test skeletons for internal components
- Define integration test boundaries
- Implement test doubles (mocks, stubs) for external dependencies


### 3.3 Refine Phase and TDD/BDD

The Refine phase implements the solution and integrates it with existing code. TDD/BDD integration focuses on:

- **Test-Driven Implementation**: Writing code to make tests pass
- **Refactoring**: Improving code quality while maintaining test coverage
- **Test Suite Optimization**: Ensuring tests are efficient and maintainable
- **Continuous Validation**: Running tests frequently to verify progress


**Implementation Actions:**

- Implement code to make unit tests pass
- Refactor for clean, maintainable code
- Implement integration tests to verify component interactions
- Run BDD scenarios to validate user-facing behavior


### 3.4 Retrospect Phase and TDD/BDD

The Retrospect phase evaluates outcomes and plans for the next iteration. TDD/BDD integration focuses on:

- **Test Effectiveness Analysis**: Evaluating how well tests detected issues
- **Test Coverage Review**: Identifying areas that need additional testing
- **Test Maintenance Planning**: Planning for test refactoring and improvement
- **Test Strategy Evolution**: Adjusting the testing approach based on lessons learned


**Implementation Actions:**

- Review test results and coverage reports
- Identify tests that need improvement
- Plan test maintenance activities
- Update testing guidelines based on lessons learned


## 4. Test Types Across EDRR Phases

### 4.1 BDD Tests (User-Facing Behavior)

BDD tests focus on user-facing behavior and are written in a language that all stakeholders can understand.

**Phase Application:**

- **Expand**: Initial scenarios based on requirements
- **Differentiate**: Refined scenarios with edge cases
- **Refine**: Implementation to make scenarios pass
- **Retrospect**: Evaluation of scenario coverage and effectiveness


### 4.2 Integration Tests (Component Interactions)

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly.

**Phase Application:**

- **Expand**: Identification of integration points
- **Differentiate**: Definition of component contracts
- **Refine**: Implementation of integration tests
- **Retrospect**: Analysis of integration test effectiveness


### 4.3 Unit Tests (Internal Components)

Unit tests verify the behavior of individual components in isolation.

**Phase Application:**

- **Expand**: Identification of testable units
- **Differentiate**: Definition of unit test cases
- **Refine**: Implementation of unit tests and code
- **Retrospect**: Analysis of unit test coverage and quality


## 5. Dialectical Reasoning in Testing

DevSynth applies dialectical reasoning to testing by considering multiple perspectives:

### 5.1 Thesis: Unit Testing Perspective

Unit tests focus on the correctness of individual components in isolation. They verify that each component behaves as expected according to its interface.

### 5.2 Antithesis: Integration Testing Perspective

Integration tests focus on the interactions between components. They verify that components work together correctly and that the system as a whole behaves as expected.

### 5.3 Synthesis: Behavior Testing Perspective

Behavior tests focus on the system's behavior from a user perspective. They verify that the system meets the user's needs and expectations, regardless of the internal implementation.

By combining these perspectives, DevSynth ensures that the system is correct at all levels of abstraction.

## 6. Implementation in DevSynth

### 6.1 Test Organization

Tests are organized into three main categories:

1. **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`): Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`): Test interactions between components
3. **Behavior Tests** (`tests/behavior/`): Test system behavior from a user perspective


### 6.2 Test-First Development Workflow

The test-first development workflow in DevSynth follows these steps:

1. **Write BDD Scenarios**: Define the feature's behavior from a user perspective
2. **Write Integration Tests**: Define how components should interact
3. **Write Unit Tests**: Define how individual components should behave
4. **Implement Code**: Write the minimum code needed to make tests pass
5. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while ensuring tests still pass


### 6.3 Continuous Testing

DevSynth supports continuous testing throughout the EDRR process:

- **Automated Test Execution**: Tests run automatically on code changes
- **Test Result Reporting**: Clear reporting of test results
- **Coverage Analysis**: Identification of code not covered by tests
- **Test Quality Metrics**: Measurement of test effectiveness


## 7. Examples

### 7.1 Promise System Example

The Promise System in DevSynth was developed using TDD/BDD integrated with EDRR:

#### Expand Phase:

```gherkin
Feature: Promise System Capability Management
  As a developer using DevSynth
  I want to use the Promise System to declare, authorize, and manage capabilities
  So that agents can collaborate securely with proper authorization

  Scenario: Agent creates a promise
    Given agent "code_agent" has capability "CODE_GENERATION"
    When agent "code_agent" creates a promise of type "CODE_GENERATION" with parameters:
      | parameter   | value                           |
      | file_path   | /project/src/module.py          |
      | language    | python                          |
      | description | Implement data processing function |
    Then a new promise should be created
    And the promise should be in "PENDING" state
    And the promise should have the specified parameters
```

#### Differentiate Phase:

```python
def test_resolve(self):
    """Test resolving a Promise."""
    promise = Promise[str]()
    promise.resolve("test value")

    assert promise.state == PromiseState.FULFILLED
    assert promise.is_fulfilled
    assert not promise.is_pending
    assert promise.value == "test value"

    # Cannot resolve again
    with pytest.raises(PromiseStateError):
        promise.resolve("another value")
```

#### Refine Phase:

```python
def resolve(self, value: T) -> None:
    """
    Resolves the promise with a given value.
    To be used by the promise's creator.

    Args:
        value: The value with which to resolve the promise

    Raises:
        PromiseStateError: If the promise is already fulfilled or rejected
    """
    if self._state != PromiseState.PENDING:
        raise PromiseStateError(f"Cannot resolve promise in state {self._state}")

    self._state = PromiseState.FULFILLED
    self._value = value
    self._metadata["resolved_at"] = None  # Will be set by calling code

    # Call all the on_fulfilled callbacks with the value
    for callback in self._on_fulfilled:
        try:
            callback(value)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error in promise callback: {e}")

    # Clear the callback lists to avoid memory leaks
    self._on_fulfilled = []
    self._on_rejected = []
```

#### Retrospect Phase:

- Review test coverage (100% for Promise class)
- Identify additional scenarios (promise chaining, timeout handling)
- Plan improvements for the next iteration


### 7.2 Methodology Adapters Example

The Methodology Adapters feature also followed the TDD/BDD-EDRR integration:

#### Expand Phase:

```gherkin
Feature: Methodology Adapters Integration
  As a developer using DevSynth
  I want to use different methodology adapters
  So that I can integrate the EDRR process with my preferred development methodology

  Scenario: Configure Sprint Methodology Adapter
    When I set the methodology type to "sprint" in the configuration
    And I configure the sprint duration to 2 weeks
    And I configure the ceremony mappings:
      | ceremony       | edrr_phase                  |
      | planning       | retrospect.iteration_planning |
      | dailyStandup   | phase_progression_tracking  |
      | review         | refine.outputs_review       |
      | retrospective  | retrospect.process_evaluation |
    Then the methodology adapter should be of type "SprintAdapter"
    And the sprint duration should be 2 weeks
    And the ceremony mappings should be correctly configured
```

## 8. Best Practices

### 8.1 Test-First Development

- Write tests before implementing functionality
- Start with high-level BDD scenarios
- Progress to more detailed unit tests
- Implement only enough code to make tests pass


### 8.2 Test Organization

- Keep tests small, focused, and independent
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Test both happy paths and error cases


### 8.3 BDD Scenario Writing

- Write scenarios from the user's perspective
- Use a ubiquitous language that all stakeholders can understand
- Keep scenarios focused on one specific behavior
- Use tables for multiple examples or complex data


### 8.4 Integration with EDRR

- Align test types with appropriate EDRR phases
- Use tests to validate progress through phases
- Apply dialectical reasoning to test design
- Use retrospectives to improve testing approach


## 9. Conclusion

Integrating TDD/BDD with the EDRR methodology creates a powerful framework for developing high-quality software that meets user needs. By aligning test-first practices with the structured phases of EDRR, DevSynth ensures that quality is built in from the beginning and maintained throughout the development process.

This integration leverages the strengths of both approaches:

- TDD/BDD provides a disciplined approach to quality and alignment with requirements
- EDRR provides a structured process for discovery, validation, implementation, and learning


Together, they create a comprehensive methodology that supports the development of robust, maintainable, and user-focused software.
