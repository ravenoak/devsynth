# TDD/BDD-EDRR Integration Training Guide

This comprehensive training guide is designed to help developers understand and implement the integration of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with DevSynth's "Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect" (EDRR) methodology.

## 1. Introduction to TDD/BDD

### 1.1 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-Driven Development is a software development approach where tests are written before the code that needs to be tested. The TDD cycle consists of three steps:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test that defines the functionality you want to implement
2. **Green**: Write the minimum amount of code needed to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while ensuring the tests still pass

Benefits of TDD include:
- Improved code quality and design
- Better test coverage
- Faster feedback on code changes
- Reduced debugging time
- More maintainable codebase

### 1.2 Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

Behavior-Driven Development extends TDD by focusing on the behavior of the system from a user's perspective. BDD uses a ubiquitous language that all stakeholders can understand, typically in the form of "Given-When-Then" scenarios.

Key components of BDD include:
- **Feature files**: Written in Gherkin syntax, describing the behavior of the system
- **Step definitions**: Code that maps the Gherkin steps to executable actions
- **Scenarios**: Specific examples of how the system should behave in different situations

Benefits of BDD include:
- Improved communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Clear documentation of system behavior
- Focus on user value and business outcomes
- Early detection of misunderstandings and gaps in requirements

## 2. Overview of EDRR Methodology

The EDRR methodology is DevSynth's approach to software development, consisting of four phases:

### 2.1 Expand Phase

The Expand phase focuses on gathering all available information and requirements. During this phase, you:
- Collect and analyze requirements
- Identify stakeholders and their needs
- Explore the problem domain
- Gather existing artifacts and knowledge

### 2.2 Differentiate Phase

The Differentiate phase validates requirements against each other and identifies inconsistencies. During this phase, you:
- Analyze relationships between requirements
- Identify conflicts and gaps
- Prioritize requirements
- Define boundaries and constraints

### 2.3 Refine Phase

The Refine phase implements the solution and integrates it with existing code. During this phase, you:
- Implement the solution
- Integrate with existing systems
- Validate against requirements
- Optimize and improve

### 2.4 Retrospect Phase

The Retrospect phase evaluates outcomes and plans for the next iteration. During this phase, you:
- Review the implementation
- Analyze what worked and what didn't
- Identify lessons learned
- Plan for the next iteration

## 3. Integration Principles

The integration of TDD/BDD with EDRR is guided by the following principles:

### 3.1 Test-First Development

Tests are written before implementation in all EDRR phases. This ensures that:
- Requirements are testable
- Implementation meets the requirements
- Quality is built in from the start

### 3.2 Multi-Level Testing

Different types of tests are applied at appropriate phases:
- BDD scenarios for user-facing behavior
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Unit tests for internal components

### 3.3 Continuous Validation

Tests serve as executable specifications that validate progress throughout the EDRR process:
- BDD scenarios validate user requirements
- Integration tests validate component interactions
- Unit tests validate internal behavior

### 3.4 Dialectical Reasoning

Multiple testing perspectives provide a comprehensive view of the system:
- Thesis: Unit testing perspective (individual components)
- Antithesis: Integration testing perspective (component interactions)
- Synthesis: Behavior testing perspective (user-facing behavior)

### 3.5 Living Documentation

Tests and scenarios serve as up-to-date documentation:
- BDD scenarios document user requirements
- Integration tests document component interactions
- Unit tests document internal behavior

## 4. Practical Examples

### 4.1 Promise System Example

The Promise System in DevSynth was developed using TDD/BDD integrated with EDRR:

#### Expand Phase:
```gherkin
Feature: Promise System Capability Management
  As a developer using DevSynth
  I want to use the Promise System to declare, authorize, and manage capabilities
  So that agents can collaborate securely with proper authorization

  Scenario: Agent creates a promise
    Given agent "code_agent" has capability "CODE_GENERATION"
    When agent "code_agent" creates a promise of type "CODE_GENERATION" with parameters:
      | parameter   | value                           |
      | file_path   | /project/src/module.py          |
      | language    | python                          |
      | description | Implement data processing function |
    Then a new promise should be created
    And the promise should be in "PENDING" state
    And the promise should have the specified parameters
```

#### Differentiate Phase:
```python
def test_resolve(self):
    """Test resolving a Promise."""
    promise = Promise[str]()
    promise.resolve("test value")

    assert promise.state == PromiseState.FULFILLED
    assert promise.is_fulfilled
    assert not promise.is_pending
    assert promise.value == "test value"

    # Cannot resolve again
    with pytest.raises(PromiseStateError):
        promise.resolve("another value")
```

#### Refine Phase:
```python
def resolve(self, value: T) -> None:
    """
    Resolves the promise with a given value.
    To be used by the promise's creator.

    Args:
        value: The value with which to resolve the promise

    Raises:
        PromiseStateError: If the promise is already fulfilled or rejected
    """
    if self._state != PromiseState.PENDING:
        raise PromiseStateError(f"Cannot resolve promise in state {self._state}")

    self._state = PromiseState.FULFILLED
    self._value = value
    self._metadata["resolved_at"] = None  # Will be set by calling code

    # Call all the on_fulfilled callbacks with the value
    for callback in self._on_fulfilled:
        try:
            callback(value)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error in promise callback: {e}")

    # Clear the callback lists to avoid memory leaks
    self._on_fulfilled = []
    self._on_rejected = []
```

#### Retrospect Phase:
- Review test coverage (100% for Promise class)
- Identify additional scenarios (promise chaining, timeout handling)
- Plan improvements for the next iteration

### 4.2 Methodology Adapters Example

The Methodology Adapters feature also followed the TDD/BDD-EDRR integration:

#### Expand Phase:
```gherkin
Feature: Methodology Adapters Integration
  As a developer using DevSynth
  I want to use different methodology adapters
  So that I can integrate the EDRR process with my preferred development methodology

  Scenario: Configure Sprint Methodology Adapter
    When I set the methodology type to "sprint" in the configuration
    And I configure the sprint duration to 2 weeks
    And I configure the ceremony mappings:
      | ceremony       | edrr_phase                  |
      | planning       | retrospect.iteration_planning |
      | dailyStandup   | phase_progression_tracking  |
      | review         | refine.outputs_review       |
      | retrospective  | retrospect.process_evaluation |
    Then the methodology adapter should be of type "SprintAdapter"
    And the sprint duration should be 2 weeks
    And the ceremony mappings should be correctly configured
```

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### 6.1 Writing Tests After Implementation

**Pitfall**: Writing tests after implementing the code defeats the purpose of TDD/BDD.

**Solution**: 
- Use pre-commit hooks to enforce test-first development
- Track test-first metrics to monitor adherence
- Pair programming with a TDD/BDD advocate

### 6.2 Overly Complex Tests

**Pitfall**: Tests that are too complex are difficult to maintain and understand.

**Solution**:
- Keep tests small and focused
- Test one behavior per test
- Use helper methods and fixtures for setup
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

### 6.3 Insufficient Test Coverage

**Pitfall**: Missing tests for edge cases and error conditions.

**Solution**:
- Use test coverage tools to identify gaps
- Include tests for error conditions and edge cases
- Use property-based testing for complex behaviors
- Review tests during code reviews

### 6.4 Brittle Tests

**Pitfall**: Tests that break when implementation details change.

**Solution**:
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Use appropriate levels of abstraction
- Avoid testing private methods directly
- Use test doubles (mocks, stubs) appropriately

### 6.5 Neglecting BDD for Technical Components

**Pitfall**: Using BDD only for user-facing features and neglecting it for technical components.

**Solution**:
- Write BDD scenarios for technical components from a developer's perspective
- Use domain-specific language for technical scenarios
- Include technical stakeholders in BDD discussions

## 7. Advanced Topics

### 7.1 Property-Based Testing

Property-based testing generates random inputs to test properties of your code. It's useful for finding edge cases and unexpected behaviors.

**Example**:
```python
from hypothesis import given
from hypothesis import strategies as st

@given(st.lists(st.integers()))
def test_sort_idempotent(lst):
    """Test that sorting a list twice gives the same result as sorting once."""
    sorted_once = sorted(lst)
    sorted_twice = sorted(sorted_once)
    assert sorted_once == sorted_twice
```

### 7.2 Mutation Testing

Mutation testing evaluates the quality of your tests by introducing small changes (mutations) to your code and checking if your tests catch them.

**Example**:
```bash
# Using the pytest-mutate plugin
poetry run pytest --mutate=src/devsynth/module.py
```

### 7.3 Test-Driven Architecture

Test-Driven Architecture applies TDD principles to architectural decisions, using tests to drive the design of the system architecture.

**Key Principles**:
- Write tests for architectural constraints
- Use tests to validate architectural decisions
- Evolve the architecture based on test feedback

### 7.4 Continuous Testing

Continuous Testing integrates testing into the development workflow, providing immediate feedback on code changes.

**Implementation**:
- Run tests automatically on code changes
- Integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline
- Use test results to gate deployments
- Monitor test metrics over time
