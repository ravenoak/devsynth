# Test-Driven and Behavior-Driven Development in DevSynth

## 1. Overview

DevSynth follows a multi-disciplined best-practices approach to software development, with Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) as core methodologies. This document explains how these methodologies are implemented in the project, provides guidelines for applying them, and demonstrates their use with concrete examples.

## 2. Principles and Benefits

### 2.1 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

TDD is a development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle:

1. Write a failing test that defines a desired improvement or new function
2. Write the minimum amount of code to make the test pass
3. Refactor the code to meet quality standards


Benefits of TDD in DevSynth:

- Ensures code correctness from the beginning
- Provides immediate feedback on code changes
- Creates a comprehensive test suite that prevents regressions
- Encourages modular, loosely coupled designs
- Serves as living documentation of the system's behavior


### 2.2 Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

BDD extends TDD by focusing on the behavior of the system from the user's perspective:

1. Define scenarios in a ubiquitous language (Gherkin) that all stakeholders can understand
2. Implement step definitions that map the scenarios to executable code
3. Run the scenarios as automated tests to verify system behavior


Benefits of BDD in DevSynth:

- Bridges the communication gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Ensures features are developed according to user needs
- Creates living documentation that describes system behavior
- Facilitates collaboration between developers, testers, and domain experts
- Provides clear acceptance criteria for features


## 3. Implementation in DevSynth

### 3.1 Testing Framework

DevSynth uses pytest as its primary testing framework, with the following extensions:

- **pytest-bdd**: For behavior-driven development
- **pytest-mock**: For mocking dependencies
- **pytest-cov**: For measuring test coverage


### 3.2 Test Organization

Tests are organized into three main categories:

1. **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`): Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`): Test interactions between components
3. **Behavior Tests** (`tests/behavior/`): Test system behavior from a user perspective


### 3.3 Hermetic Testing

All tests in DevSynth follow hermetic testing principles:

- Tests are isolated from each other and from the external environment
- Tests use temporary directories for file operations
- External services are mocked
- Environment variables are saved and restored
- Global state is reset between tests


For more details, see the [Hermetic Testing Guide](hermetic_testing.md).

## 4. TDD Workflow

### 4.1 Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify the requirement**: Clearly define what functionality you need to implement
2. **Write a failing test**: Create a test that verifies the functionality (it should fail initially)
3. **Run the test**: Confirm that it fails for the expected reason
4. **Implement the functionality**: Write the minimum code needed to make the test pass
5. **Run the test again**: Confirm that it now passes
6. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while ensuring the test still passes
7. **Repeat**: Continue the cycle for additional functionality


### 4.2 Example: Promise System Unit Test

The Promise System in DevSynth was developed using TDD. Here's an example of a test for the Promise class:

```python
def test_resolve(self):
    """Test resolving a Promise."""
    promise = Promise[str]()
    promise.resolve("test value")

    assert promise.state == PromiseState.FULFILLED
    assert promise.is_fulfilled
    assert not promise.is_pending
    assert promise.value == "test value"

    # Cannot resolve again
    with pytest.raises(PromiseStateError):
        promise.resolve("another value")
```

This test:

1. Creates a Promise instance
2. Resolves it with a value
3. Verifies that the state and properties are correct
4. Verifies that attempting to resolve it again raises an error


The implementation was then written to satisfy this test:

```python
def resolve(self, value: T) -> None:
    """
    Resolves the promise with a given value.
    To be used by the promise's creator.

    Args:
        value: The value with which to resolve the promise

    Raises:
        PromiseStateError: If the promise is already fulfilled or rejected
    """
    if self._state != PromiseState.PENDING:
        raise PromiseStateError(f"Cannot resolve promise in state {self._state}")

    self._state = PromiseState.FULFILLED
    self._value = value
    self._metadata["resolved_at"] = None  # Will be set by calling code

    # Call all the on_fulfilled callbacks with the value
    for callback in self._on_fulfilled:
        try:
            callback(value)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error in promise callback: {e}")

    # Clear the callback lists to avoid memory leaks
    self._on_fulfilled = []
    self._on_rejected = []
```

## 5. BDD Workflow

### 5.1 Step-by-Step Process

1. **Define the feature**: Create a `.feature` file that describes the feature in Gherkin syntax
2. **Write scenarios**: Define concrete examples of how the feature should behave
3. **Implement step definitions**: Write code that maps the Gherkin steps to executable actions
4. **Run the scenarios**: Execute the scenarios to verify the feature's behavior
5. **Implement the feature**: Write the code needed to make the scenarios pass
6. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while ensuring the scenarios still pass


### 5.2 Example: Promise System BDD Test

The Promise System also has BDD tests that describe its behavior from a user perspective:

```gherkin
Feature: Promise System Capability Management
  As a developer using DevSynth
  I want to use the Promise System to declare, authorize, and manage capabilities
  So that agents can collaborate securely with proper authorization

  Scenario: Agent creates a promise
    Given agent "code_agent" has capability "CODE_GENERATION"
    When agent "code_agent" creates a promise of type "CODE_GENERATION" with parameters:
      | parameter   | value                           |
      | file_path   | /project/src/module.py          |
      | language    | python                          |
      | description | Implement data processing function |
    Then a new promise should be created
    And the promise should be in "PENDING" state
    And the promise should have the specified parameters
```

The step definitions implement these steps:

```python
@given(parsers.parse('agent "{agent_id}" has capability "{capability}"'))
def agent_has_capability_given(context, agent_id, capability):
    """Given that an agent has a capability."""
    promise_type = getattr(PromiseType, capability)
    constraints = {"max_file_size": 1000000, "allowed_languages": ["python", "javascript", "typescript"]}
    context.promise_broker.register_capability(agent_id, promise_type, constraints)
    context.capabilities[f"{agent_id}:{capability}"] = constraints

@when(parsers.parse('agent "{agent_id}" creates a promise of type "{capability}" with parameters:'))
def agent_creates_promise(context, agent_id, capability, table):
    """Create a promise of a specific type with parameters."""
    agent = context.agents[agent_id]
    parameters = {row['parameter']: row['value'] for row in table}
    promise_type = getattr(PromiseType, capability)

    promise = agent.create_promise(
        type=promise_type,
        parameters=parameters,
        context_id="test_context"
    )

    context.promises[f"{agent_id}:{capability}"] = promise

@then("a new promise should be created")
def promise_created(context):
    """Verify that a new promise was created."""
    assert len(context.promises) > 0, "A promise should have been created"

@then(parsers.parse('the promise should be in "{state}" state'))
def promise_in_state(context, state):
    """Verify that the promise is in the specified state."""
    promise = list(context.promises.values())[-1]  # Get the last created promise
    assert promise.state.name == state, f"Promise should be in {state} state, but was in {promise.state.name}"

@then("the promise should have the specified parameters")
def promise_has_parameters(context):
    """Verify that the promise has the specified parameters."""
    promise = list(context.promises.values())[-1]  # Get the last created promise
    assert promise.parameters is not None, "Promise should have parameters"
    assert "file_path" in promise.parameters, "Promise parameters should include file_path"
    assert "language" in promise.parameters, "Promise parameters should include language"
    assert "description" in promise.parameters, "Promise parameters should include description"
```

## 5. Specification and Test Traceability

DevSynth follows a specification-first workflow to maintain strong links between requirements, tests, and implementation:

1. Draft or update a specification in `docs/specifications/` using `spec_template.md`. Fill in all required metadata (`author`, `date`, `last_reviewed`, `status`, `tags`, `title`, `version`) and address the Socratic questions:
   - What is the problem?
   - What proofs confirm the solution?
2. Add or update tests in `tests/` that initially fail and validate the desired behavior.

A pre-commit hook (`scripts/check_spec_or_test_updates.py`) enforces this policy by rejecting commits that modify code in `src/` or `scripts/` without accompanying specification or test changes.

## 6. Dialectical Reasoning in Testing

DevSynth applies dialectical reasoning to testing by considering multiple perspectives:

### 6.1 Thesis: Unit Testing Perspective

Unit tests focus on the correctness of individual components in isolation. They verify that each component behaves as expected according to its interface.

### 6.2 Antithesis: Integration Testing Perspective

Integration tests focus on the interactions between components. They verify that components work together correctly and that the system as a whole behaves as expected.

### 6.3 Synthesis: Behavior Testing Perspective

Behavior tests focus on the system's behavior from a user perspective. They verify that the system meets the user's needs and expectations, regardless of the internal implementation.

By combining these perspectives, DevSynth ensures that the system is correct at all levels of abstraction.

## 7. Best Practices

### 7.1 General Testing Guidelines

- Write tests before implementing functionality (TDD)
- Keep tests small, focused, and independent
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Test both happy paths and error cases
- Aim for high test coverage, but focus on critical paths
- Use mocks and stubs to isolate components


### 7.2 BDD-Specific Guidelines

- Write scenarios from the user's perspective
- Use a ubiquitous language that all stakeholders can understand
- Keep scenarios focused on one specific behavior
- Use tables for multiple examples or complex data
- Reuse step definitions where appropriate
- Keep step definitions simple and focused


### 7.3 TDD-Specific Guidelines

- Start with the simplest test case
- Write only enough code to make the test pass
- Refactor after each passing test
- Use test doubles (mocks, stubs) to isolate dependencies
- Test edge cases and error conditions


## 8. Conclusion

Test-Driven and Behavior-Driven Development are essential methodologies in DevSynth's development process. By following these approaches, we ensure that our code is correct, maintainable, and aligned with user needs. The combination of unit tests, integration tests, and behavior tests provides a comprehensive testing strategy that covers all aspects of the system.

By applying dialectical reasoning to our testing approach, we consider multiple perspectives and ensure that our system is robust and well-designed at all levels of abstraction.
