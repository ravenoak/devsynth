# Test Isolation Analyzer

## Overview

The Test Isolation Analyzer is a sophisticated tool for analyzing test files for potential isolation issues and providing recommendations for improving test isolation and determinism. It helps address the "test isolation and determinism" issues mentioned in the project's task progress documentation.

This document provides detailed information about the Test Isolation Analyzer, including its purpose, functionality, and usage.

## Key Features

1. **Global State Detection**: Identifies usage of global state in tests
2. **Shared Resource Analysis**: Detects shared resources between tests
3. **Fixture Pattern Analysis**: Analyzes fixture usage patterns
4. **State Leakage Detection**: Identifies potential state leakage between tests
5. **Best Practices Generation**: Provides recommendations for improving test isolation and determinism

## Architecture

The Test Isolation Analyzer consists of several key components:

### IsolationVisitor Class

The `IsolationVisitor` class is an AST visitor that finds potential isolation issues in tests. It handles:

- Detecting global variable usage
- Identifying shared resource usage
- Analyzing fixture definitions and usage
- Checking for setup/teardown methods
- Detecting mocking patterns

### Core Functions

- `analyze_test_file(file_path)`: Analyzes a test file for potential isolation issues
- `analyze_test_isolation(directory="tests")`: Analyzes test isolation issues in a directory
- `generate_isolation_best_practices()`: Generates best practices for test isolation and determinism
- `generate_recommendations(visitor)`: Generates recommendations based on isolation issues

### Detection Patterns

The analyzer uses several pattern sets to detect potential issues:

1. **Global State Patterns**: Patterns for detecting global state usage
2. **Shared Resource Patterns**: Patterns for detecting shared resource usage
3. **Mocking Patterns**: Patterns for detecting mocking usage

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from test_isolation_analyzer import analyze_test_isolation, analyze_test_file

# Analyze all tests in a directory
report = analyze_test_isolation("tests/unit")

# Analyze a specific test file
file_report = analyze_test_file("tests/unit/test_example.py")
```

### Generating Best Practices

```python
from test_isolation_analyzer import generate_isolation_best_practices

# Generate best practices for test isolation and determinism
best_practices = generate_isolation_best_practices()

# Access best practices by category
fixture_practices = best_practices["fixtures"]
mocking_practices = best_practices["mocking"]
state_management_practices = best_practices["state_management"]
```

### Command-Line Usage

The Test Isolation Analyzer can also be used from the command line:

```bash
# Analyze a directory
python test_isolation_analyzer.py --directory tests/unit

# Analyze a specific file
python test_isolation_analyzer.py --file tests/unit/test_example.py

# Generate best practices
python test_isolation_analyzer.py --best-practices

# Save results to a file
python test_isolation_analyzer.py --directory tests/unit --output isolation_report.json

# Show detailed information
python test_isolation_analyzer.py --directory tests/unit --verbose
```

## Issue Detection Details

The Test Isolation Analyzer detects several types of potential isolation issues:

### Global State Issues

- Global variable declarations (`global var_name`)
- Module-level variable assignments
- Environment variable modifications (`os.environ["VAR"] = value`)
- System path modifications (`sys.path.append()`)
- File writing without using tmpdir

### Shared Resource Issues

- Database connections (`.connect()`)
- File or connection opening (`.open()`)
- HTTP requests (`requests.`)
- Socket operations (`socket.`)
- Subprocess operations (`subprocess.`)

### Fixture Issues

- Missing teardown in fixtures with yield
- Missing yield or return in fixtures
- Missing setup or teardown methods in test classes

### Mocking Issues

- Mocking without proper cleanup
- Patching without using monkeypatch

## Analysis Results

The `analyze_test_file` function returns a dictionary with the following information:

- **file**: Path to the analyzed file
- **issues**: List of detected issues
- **global_vars**: List of global variables used in the file
- **fixture_uses**: Dictionary mapping fixture names to the tests that use them
- **fixture_defs**: Dictionary with information about fixture definitions
- **has_setup_teardown**: Whether the file has proper setup and teardown methods
- **recommendations**: List of recommendations for improving test isolation

The `analyze_test_isolation` function returns a dictionary with the following information:

- **total_files**: Total number of files analyzed
- **files_with_issues**: Number of files with detected issues
- **total_issues**: Total number of detected issues
- **issues_by_type**: Dictionary mapping issue types to counts
- **files**: List of file results
- **recommendations**: List of recommendations for improving test isolation

## Best Practices

The `generate_isolation_best_practices` function returns a dictionary with best practices organized by category:

### Fixtures

- Use function-scoped fixtures for isolated tests
- Use module-scoped fixtures for expensive setup that can be shared
- Always clean up resources in fixtures (use yield for teardown)
- Use autouse=True sparingly, only for truly global setup/teardown
- Prefer explicit fixture dependencies over implicit ones

### Mocking

- Use monkeypatch fixture for patching
- Reset mocks between tests
- Avoid patching too deep in the call stack
- Be specific about what you're patching
- Verify that mocks are called as expected

### State Management

- Avoid global variables in tests
- Don't rely on test execution order
- Reset shared state between tests
- Use tmpdir fixture for file operations
- Isolate database operations with transactions or separate databases

### Test Design

- Write small, focused tests
- Test one thing at a time
- Make tests independent of each other
- Avoid conditional logic in tests
- Use parameterized tests for testing multiple cases

### Debugging

- Use --showlocals for detailed failure information
- Use -v for verbose output
- Use --tb=native for Python-style tracebacks
- Use --collect-only to verify test collection
- Use -xvs to exit on first failure with verbose output and no capture

## Recommendations

The analyzer generates recommendations based on the detected issues. Common recommendations include:

1. **Avoid Global State**:
   - Replace global variables with function-scoped fixtures
   - Use pytest fixtures for shared state

2. **Improve Fixture Usage**:
   - Add teardown code after yield in fixtures
   - Add return or yield to fixtures that don't have them
   - Use function-scoped fixtures for isolated tests

3. **Handle Shared Resources**:
   - Use function-scoped fixtures for shared resources
   - Consider using mocks for external resources
   - Reset shared resources between tests

4. **Improve File Operations**:
   - Always use tmpdir fixture for file operations
   - Isolate file operations to prevent interference between tests

5. **Enhance Mocking**:
   - Ensure mocks are reset between tests
   - Use monkeypatch fixture for patching
   - Be specific about what you're patching

## Integration with Other Tools

The Test Isolation Analyzer is designed to work with other test infrastructure tools:

- **Enhanced Test Parser**: Uses the parser for accurate test detection
- **Enhanced Test Collector**: Integrates with the collector for generating isolation reports
- **Generate Comprehensive Reports**: Used by the report generator for test isolation analysis

## Limitations

1. **Pattern-Based Detection**: The analyzer uses pattern matching, which may miss some issues or produce false positives
2. **Syntax Errors**: The analyzer cannot analyze files with syntax errors
3. **Complex Patterns**: Some complex isolation issues may not be detected
4. **Dynamic Code**: Issues in dynamically generated code may not be detected

## Best Practices for Using the Analyzer

1. **Focus on High-Priority Modules**: Start by analyzing high-priority modules
2. **Review Recommendations**: Review and apply the recommendations provided by the analyzer
3. **Combine with Manual Review**: Use the analyzer as a tool to guide manual code review
4. **Apply Best Practices**: Implement the best practices provided by the analyzer
5. **Save Reports for Tracking**: Save reports to track progress over time

## Conclusion

The Test Isolation Analyzer provides a powerful tool for identifying and addressing test isolation issues. By detecting potential issues and providing recommendations, it helps improve the reliability and determinism of the test suite.

The best practices generated by the analyzer provide a comprehensive guide for writing isolated and deterministic tests, making it easier to maintain and extend the test suite over time.

By using the Test Isolation Analyzer as part of the development workflow, teams can ensure that their tests are reliable, deterministic, and maintainable.
