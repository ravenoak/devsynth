# FAISS Installation Guide for macOS

This guide addresses common issues with installing and using the `faiss-cpu` package on macOS systems, which is required for vector similarity search in DevSynth's memory components.

## Common Issues on macOS

The `faiss-cpu` package often encounters installation and runtime issues on macOS due to:

1. **OpenMP Dependency**: FAISS requires OpenMP, which is not included by default on macOS
2. **Compilation Errors**: Standard pip installation may fail due to missing compiler flags
3. **Runtime Crashes**: Even when installed, FAISS may crash with segmentation faults
4. **M1/M2 Compatibility**: Additional issues on Apple Silicon (M1/M2) processors

## Solution 1: Using Conda (Recommended)

The most reliable way to install FAISS on macOS is through Conda:

```bash

# Create a new conda environment

conda create -n devsynth-env python=3.12
conda activate devsynth-env

# Install faiss-cpu from conda-forge

conda install -c conda-forge faiss-cpu

# Install DevSynth in the same environment

cd /path/to/devsynth
pip install -e .
```

## Solution 2: Using Homebrew and pip

If you prefer not to use Conda, you can install the OpenMP dependency with Homebrew:

```bash

# Install libomp with Homebrew

brew install libomp

# Set compiler flags

export CFLAGS="-Xpreprocessor -fopenmp"
export CXXFLAGS="-Xpreprocessor -fopenmp"
export LDFLAGS="-lomp"

# Install faiss-cpu

pip install faiss-cpu
```

## Solution 3: Using Docker

To completely avoid macOS-specific issues, you can use the Docker container:

```bash

# Build and run the Docker container

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

# Execute commands inside the container

docker exec -it devsynth-devsynth-1 bash
```

## Troubleshooting

### Segmentation Faults

If you encounter segmentation faults when using FAISS:

1. Ensure you're using a clean Python environment
2. Verify that libomp is correctly installed and linked
3. Try downgrading to an earlier version: `pip install faiss-cpu==1.7.3`

### ImportError: Library not loaded

If you see an error like `ImportError: dlopen(... Library not loaded: @rpath/libomp.dylib`:

```bash

# Install libomp

brew install libomp

# Create symlinks to the library

sudo ln -s "$(brew --prefix libomp)/lib/libomp.dylib" /usr/local/lib/libomp.dylib
```

## Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Issues

For Apple Silicon Macs:

1. Use Rosetta 2 with x86_64 Python: `arch -x86_64 python -m pip install faiss-cpu`
2. Or preferably use Conda with the conda-forge channel which has native ARM builds

## Testing FAISS Installation

To verify your FAISS installation is working correctly:

```python
import numpy as np
try:
    import faiss
    print("FAISS imported successfully")
    
    # Create a simple index
    dimension = 128
    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)
    
    # Add some vectors
    vectors = np.random.random((100, dimension)).astype(np.float32)
    index.add(vectors)
    
    # Search
    query = np.random.random((1, dimension)).astype(np.float32)
    distances, indices = index.search(query, 5)
    
    print("FAISS search successful")
    print(f"Found indices: {indices}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"FAISS test failed: {e}")
```

## Docker Configuration for macOS

The DevSynth Dockerfile has been updated to handle macOS-specific issues with FAISS. When using Docker on macOS:

1. The container includes all necessary dependencies for FAISS
2. Tests that require FAISS are skipped by default to prevent crashes
3. To enable FAISS tests, set the environment variable: `DEVSYNTH_RESOURCE_FAISS_AVAILABLE=true`
