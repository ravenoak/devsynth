# Technical Debt Documentation

## Overview

This document identifies and tracks technical debt in the DevSynth project. Technical debt represents implementation compromises, design issues, or incomplete features that need to be addressed in future development cycles.

## Current Technical Debt Items

### 1. EDRR Implementation

**Description**: The EDRR (Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect) cycle is implemented through the `EDRRCoordinator` and is actively used in development.

**Impact**: Enables the iterative workflow across agents; only minor enhancements remain.

**Current Functionality and Remaining Improvements**:

1. `EDRRCoordinator` orchestrates each phase and integrates with the WSDE model and memory system.
2. Stage-specific prompts and basic metrics are in place.
3. Ongoing work focuses on refining evaluation metrics and improving configurability.


**Priority**: High

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks

### 2. WSDE Message Passing Protocol

**Description**: The message passing protocol is now implemented in
`application/collaboration/message_protocol.py`. Agents can exchange structured
messages with JSON persistence and optional memory integration. The current
implementation covers basic message types and storage but lacks advanced
features such as priority queues and robust history queries.

**Impact**: Multi-agent collaboration works, though efficiency and rich history
capabilities are still limited.

**Remaining Improvements**:

1. Enhance message priority handling
2. Improve history tracking and search features
3. Expand persistence options and error handling
4. Tighten integration with the memory system for long-term storage


**Priority**: High

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

### 3. Peer Review Mechanism

**Description**: The peer review mechanism for agent outputs is now fully implemented and validated with integration tests.

**Impact**: Provides robust quality assurance for agent outputs and improves collaboration effectiveness.

**Remediation Steps**: *Completed in version 0.1.0*


**Priority**: Medium

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

### 4. Advanced Query Patterns

**Description**: Advanced query patterns across memory stores have been specified and have Gherkin scenarios, but lack implementation.

**Impact**: Inefficient information retrieval and limited ability to leverage the full hybrid memory architecture.

**Remediation Steps**:

1. Implement the query router component
2. Develop direct, cross-store, cascading, federated, and context-aware query patterns
3. Implement query result aggregation and ranking
4. Add query optimization and caching
5. Integrate with the memory manager


**Priority**: Medium

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks

### 5. Memory Store Synchronization

**Description**: Synchronization between memory stores has been specified and has Gherkin scenarios, but lacks implementation.

**Impact**: Potential inconsistency between different memory stores and data duplication.

**Remediation Steps**:

1. Implement the synchronization manager component
2. Develop conflict detection and resolution mechanisms
3. Implement transaction boundaries across stores
4. Add asynchronous synchronization with eventual consistency
5. Implement synchronization logging and monitoring


**Priority**: Medium

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

### 6. Inconsistent Naming in CLI Adapter *(Resolved)*

**Description**: The CLI adapter previously named `typer_adapter.py` actually used `argparse`.
This caused confusion for developers.

**Resolution**: The adapter now uses Typer and is implemented in `typer_adapter.py`.
All imports and documentation have been updated accordingly.

**Priority**: Low

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

## Test Failures and Planned Fixes

Recent test runs reveal failures primarily in the Web UI requirements wizard and
the Kuzu-backed memory system. Planned fixes include refining navigation logic
in the wizard and adjusting initialization for the Kuzu vector store to ensure
consistent behavior across environments.

## Monitoring and Resolution

Technical debt items should be reviewed regularly during sprint planning and prioritized based on their impact and alignment with project goals. Items should be added to this document as they are identified and removed once they are resolved.

The technical debt backlog should be reviewed at least once per quarter to ensure it remains current and accurately reflects the state of the project.
