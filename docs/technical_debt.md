# Technical Debt Documentation

## Overview

This document identifies and tracks technical debt in the DevSynth project. Technical debt represents implementation compromises, design issues, or incomplete features that need to be addressed in future development cycles.

## Current Technical Debt Items

### 1. EDRR Implementation

**Description**: The EDRR (Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect) cycle specification has been created, but the implementation is incomplete.

**Impact**: Limited ability to leverage the full iterative development process that EDRR enables.

**Remediation Steps**:

1. Implement the `EDRRCoordinator` class as specified in the EDRR specification
2. Develop stage-specific prompts for each EDRR phase
3. Implement metrics and evaluation mechanisms for EDRR performance
4. Integrate EDRR coordinator with the WSDE model and memory system


**Priority**: High

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks

### 2. WSDE Message Passing Protocol

**Description**: The message passing protocol between agents has been specified and has Gherkin scenarios, but lacks implementation.

**Impact**: Agents cannot effectively communicate in a structured way, limiting multi-agent collaboration.

**Remediation Steps**:

1. Implement the message protocol data structures
2. Develop the message passing infrastructure
3. Implement message priority handling
4. Add message history tracking and persistence
5. Integrate with the memory system for message storage


**Priority**: High

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

### 3. Peer Review Mechanism

**Description**: The peer review mechanism for agent outputs has been specified and has Gherkin scenarios, but lacks implementation.

**Impact**: Limited quality assurance for agent outputs and reduced collaboration effectiveness.

**Remediation Steps**:

1. Implement the peer review request and assignment system
2. Develop the review evaluation framework
3. Implement the feedback aggregation mechanism
4. Add revision tracking and approval workflow
5. Integrate with the dialectical reasoning system


**Priority**: Medium

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

### 4. Advanced Query Patterns

**Description**: Advanced query patterns across memory stores have been specified and have Gherkin scenarios, but lack implementation.

**Impact**: Inefficient information retrieval and limited ability to leverage the full hybrid memory architecture.

**Remediation Steps**:

1. Implement the query router component
2. Develop direct, cross-store, cascading, federated, and context-aware query patterns
3. Implement query result aggregation and ranking
4. Add query optimization and caching
5. Integrate with the memory manager


**Priority**: Medium

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks

### 5. Memory Store Synchronization

**Description**: Synchronization between memory stores has been specified and has Gherkin scenarios, but lacks implementation.

**Impact**: Potential inconsistency between different memory stores and data duplication.

**Remediation Steps**:

1. Implement the synchronization manager component
2. Develop conflict detection and resolution mechanisms
3. Implement transaction boundaries across stores
4. Add asynchronous synchronization with eventual consistency
5. Implement synchronization logging and monitoring


**Priority**: Medium

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

### 6. Inconsistent Naming in CLI Adapter *(Resolved)*

**Description**: The CLI adapter previously named `typer_adapter.py` actually used `argparse`.
This caused confusion for developers.

**Resolution**: The adapter now uses Typer and is implemented in `typer_adapter.py`.
All imports and documentation have been updated accordingly.

**Priority**: Low

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

## Monitoring and Resolution

Technical debt items should be reviewed regularly during sprint planning and prioritized based on their impact and alignment with project goals. Items should be added to this document as they are identified and removed once they are resolved.

The technical debt backlog should be reviewed at least once per quarter to ensure it remains current and accurately reflects the state of the project.
