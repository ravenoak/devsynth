# DevSynth SDLC Policies

This directory contains policies and best practices for each phase of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) in DevSynth. These policies are designed to guide both human and agentic contributors, ensuring high quality, compliance, and effective collaboration across all project activities.

## Policy Index

- [Development Policy](development.md)
- [Testing Policy](testing.md)

Refer to these policies before starting work in any SDLC phase. For a summary, see the [Documentation Home](../index.md) and [Contributing Guide](../developer_guides/contributing.md).

## Implementation Status
These policies are **fully implemented** and serve as mandatory guidelines for
all contributors.
