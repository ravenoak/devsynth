# DevSynth SDLC Policies and Standards Index

This document serves as the central index and navigation point for all Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) policies, standards, and governance documents in the DevSynth project. It provides a comprehensive overview of all policies and references that guide development, testing, deployment, and maintenance activities for both human contributors and agentic LLMs.

## Core SDLC Policies

| Policy Area | Document | Description | Status |
|-------------|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Requirements** | [Requirements Policy](requirements.md) | Standards for requirements gathering, documentation, and traceability | Implemented |
| **Design** | [Design Policy](design.md) | Architectural principles, design standards, and review process | Implemented |
| **Development** | [Development Policy](development.md) | Coding standards, contribution workflow, and code review process | Implemented |
| **Testing** | [Testing Policy](testing.md) | Test coverage requirements, isolation standards, and verification | Implemented |
| **Deployment** | [Deployment Policy](deployment.md) | Deployment workflow, environment management, and release process | Implemented |
| **Maintenance** | [Maintenance Policy](maintenance.md) | Bug fixing, enhancement process, and version management | Implemented |
| **Cross-Cutting** | [Cross-Cutting Concerns](cross_cutting.md) | Security, performance, accessibility, and other cross-cutting concerns | Implemented |
| **Privacy** | [Privacy Policy](privacy.md) | Data handling and user privacy commitments | Implemented |
| **Data Retention** | [Data Retention Policy](data_retention.md) | How long different data types are stored | Implemented |
| **Alignment** | [Continuous Alignment Process](continuous_alignment_process.md) | Processes, checks, and metrics for maintaining alignment between SDLC artifacts | Implemented |
| **Periodic Review** | [Periodic Review Process](periodic_review.md) | Schedule and responsibilities for recurring policy reviews | Implemented |
| **Dialectical Audit** | [Dialectical Audit Policy](dialectical_audit.md) | Socratic dialogue procedures for resolving inconsistencies | Implemented |

## Implementation Guides

These guides provide practical implementation details for the policies:

| Guide | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Contributing Guide** | [Contributing](../developer_guides/contributing.md) | How to contribute to the project following SDLC policies |
| **Development Setup** | [Development Setup](../developer_guides/development_setup.md) | Setting up a development environment |
| **Testing Guide** | [Testing Guide](../developer_guides/testing.md) | Detailed guide for implementing tests following the testing policy |
| **Code Style Guide** | [Code Style](../developer_guides/code_style.md) | Code formatting and style standards |

## Architecture & Design Documentation

Architecture documents that align with and implement the design policies:

| Document | Description | Related Policy |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| [Architecture Overview](../architecture/overview.md) | High-level system architecture | Design Policy |
| [Hexagonal Architecture](../architecture/hexagonal_architecture.md) | Details of the hexagonal architecture pattern | Design Policy |
| [Agent System](../architecture/agent_system.md) | Architecture of the agent system | Design Policy |
| [Memory System](../architecture/memory_system.md) | Architecture of the memory system | Design Policy |
| [Provider System](../architecture/provider_system.md) | Architecture of the provider system | Design Policy |
| [Dialectical Reasoning](../architecture/dialectical_reasoning.md) | Architecture of the dialectical reasoning system | Design Policy |

## Traceability & Verification

Documents that ensure traceability between requirements, implementation, and testing:

| Document | Description | Related Policies |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| [Requirements Traceability Matrix](../requirements_traceability.md) | Links requirements to design, code, and tests | Requirements, Testing |
| [Repository Structure](../repo_structure.md) | Map of the repository structure | Development, Cross-Cutting |

## Standards Implementation

Key implementation artifacts that embody the standards:

| Implementation | Description | Related Policy |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| [Test Fixtures](../../tests/behavior/conftest.py) | Test fixtures ensuring isolation and cleanliness | Testing Policy |
| [Provider System](../../src/devsynth/adapters/provider_system.py) | Provider abstraction with fallback | Development, Design Policy |
| [Memory Store](../../src/devsynth/adapters/chromadb_memory_store.py) | ChromaDB memory store with provider integration | Development, Design Policy |

## Documentation Structure

The overall documentation structure follows the patterns defined in the [Documentation Policies](documentation_policies.md):

- `policies/` - SDLC policies and standards
- `architecture/` - System architecture and design
- `developer_guides/` - Implementation guides for developers
- `technical_reference/` - API and technical details
- `user_guides/` - End-user documentation
- `getting_started/` - Quick start and onboarding
- `specifications/` - Project specifications (current and archived)


## Governance

This policy corpus is governed by the following principles:

1. **Consistency**: All policies must be consistent with each other and with implementation
2. **Traceability**: All requirements must be traceable to implementation and tests
3. **Clarity**: Policies must be clear, unambiguous, and actionable
4. **Completeness**: The policy set must cover all SDLC phases and cross-cutting concerns
5. **Maintainability**: Policies must be maintained and updated as the project evolves


## Policy Lifecycle

Policies follow this lifecycle:

1. **Draft**: Initial policy creation
2. **Review**: Peer review by contributors
3. **Approval**: Approval by project maintainers
4. **Implementation**: Guidelines implemented in code and documentation
5. **Verification**: Confirming policy is followed in practice
6. **Maintenance**: Regular review and updates


## For Agentic Contributors

LLM agents and AI systems contributing to DevSynth should:

1. Consult the relevant policy documents before making changes
2. Follow the guidelines in the Developer Guides
3. Ensure all requirements are linked in the Traceability Matrix
4. Update documentation alongside code changes
5. Verify changes against the relevant architectural standards
6. Ensure tests meet isolation and coverage requirements
