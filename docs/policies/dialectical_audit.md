# Dialectical Audit Policy

This policy defines how Socratic dialogues support audits that seek consensus between documentation, implementation, and tests.

## Preparation

- Use automated tools to surface inconsistencies among docs, code, and tests.
- Convert inconsistencies into open questions that challenge assumptions.

## Continuous Integration

- The dialectical audit script runs in continuous integration.
- The build fails if `dialectical_audit.log` contains unanswered questions.
- Release verification halts when `dialectical_audit.log` records unresolved questions.
- The log is archived as a workflow artifact for review.

## Dialogue Procedure

1. Present each question to all relevant contributors.
2. Record arguments, counterarguments, and supporting evidence.
3. Capture resolutions or actions for unresolved questions.

## Documentation

- Maintain a log of questions and resolutions in `dialectical_audit.log` produced by the audit script.
- Update docs, code, and tests to reflect agreed resolutions.

## Review

- Include the audit log in code reviews and release discussions.
- Verify that all questions are resolved or tracked as issues before closing the audit.
