# Requirements Policy

This policy defines best practices for requirements gathering, documentation, and traceability in DevSynth.

## Key Practices

- Maintain a clear Product Requirements Document (PRD) in `docs/specifications/current/`.
- Use unique IDs for each requirement (e.g., REQ-001) and reference them in code, tests, and commits.
- Maintain a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) to link requirements to design, code, and tests.
- Include a glossary for domain-specific terms in `docs/glossary.md`.
- Explicitly document constraints, ethics, and compliance requirements.

## Artifacts

- PRD: `docs/specifications/current/devsynth_specification.md`
- RTM: `docs/requirements_traceability.csv` (or as a table in the PRD)
- Glossary: `docs/glossary.md`
