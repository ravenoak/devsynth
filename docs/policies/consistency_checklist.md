- [x] Add examples of using TinyDBMemoryAdapter and RDFLibStore


### Behavior Files

- [ ] Ensure behavior files accurately reflect the capabilities of the memory system
- [ ] Update step definitions to use the actual implementations instead of mocks
- [ ] Add tests for the multi-layered memory approach


## EDRR (Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect)

### Diagrams

- [x] Ensure diagrams show the integration with other components
- [x] Add a note about the implementation status of each component


### Pseudocode

- [x] Update pseudocode examples to use the actual EDRRCoordinator implementation
- [x] Add examples of how to use the EDRRCoordinator for each phase
- [x] Include examples of integration with the manifest parser


### Behavior Files

- [ ] Update step definitions to use the actual EDRRCoordinator implementation instead of mocks
- [ ] Add tests for the integration with other components
- [ ] Ensure behavior files cover all phases of the EDRR
- [ ] Document how to verify Retrospect reports against `CoreValues`


## WSDE (WSDE)

### Diagrams

- [x] Create or update diagrams showing the WSDE model
- [x] Ensure diagrams show the extensive functionality of the WSDE model
- [x] Add a note about the implementation status of each component


### Pseudocode

- [x] Update pseudocode examples to show the advanced features of the WSDE model
- [x] Add examples of dialectical reasoning, consensus building, and knowledge integration
- [x] Include examples of integration with other components


### Behavior Files

- [ ] Ensure behavior files cover all aspects of the WSDE model
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases and complex scenarios
- [ ] Update step definitions to use the actual implementations


## Offline Documentation & Lazy-Loading

### Diagrams

- [x] Create diagrams showing the planned documentation ingestion component
- [x] Ensure diagrams show the integration with `.devsynth/project.yaml`
- [x] Add a note about the implementation status (see [Documentation Ingestion Overview](../architecture/documentation_ingestion.md))


### Pseudocode

- [x] Create pseudocode examples for the documentation ingestion component
- [x] Add examples of using the DocStore
- [x] Include examples of lazy-loading


### Behavior Files

- [x] Create behavior files for the documentation ingestion component

- [x] Ensure behavior files cover all aspects of the feature


## AST-based Transformations

### Diagrams

- [ ] Create diagrams showing the planned AST transformer implementation
- [ ] Ensure diagrams show the integration with the EDRR "Refine" phase
- [ ] Add a note about the implementation status


### Pseudocode

- [ ] Create pseudocode examples for the AST transformer

### System Requirements Specification

- [ ] Update system_requirements_specification.md to reflect the actual implementation status
- [ ] Ensure the functional and non-functional requirements are accurate
- [ ] Update the data requirements to match the actual data model


## Implementation Plan

### NEXT_ITERATIONS.md

- [x] Replace with NEXT_ITERATIONS_UPDATED.md to accurately reflect the implementation status
- [ ] Ensure the plan of action and priorities are aligned with the IMPLEMENTATION_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md


### IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

- [ ] Update to align with IMPLEMENTATION_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md
- [ ] Ensure the timeline is realistic and achievable
- [ ] Add more details about the implementation approach for each component


## Consistency Verification Process

1. **Documentation Review**
   - Review all documentation files to ensure they accurately reflect the implementation status
   - Check for inconsistencies between different documentation files
   - Update any outdated information

2. **Code-Documentation Alignment**
   - Verify that the code matches the documentation
   - Check that all documented features are actually implemented
   - Update documentation to match the code where necessary

3. **Behavior Test Alignment**
   - Ensure behavior tests accurately reflect the capabilities of the system
   - Update step definitions to use actual implementations instead of mocks
   - Add tests for any missing features

4. **Diagram Verification**
   - Check that all diagrams accurately represent the system architecture
   - Update diagrams to show the correct relationships between components
   - Add notes about implementation status to diagrams

5. **Final Consistency Check**
   - Perform a final review of all documentation, code, and tests
   - Ensure all inconsistencies have been addressed
   - Update the consistency checklist with the results


## Conclusion

This consistency checklist provides a structured approach to ensuring that all diagrams, pseudocode, behavior files, and other documentation in the DevSynth project are consistent with the updated understanding of the implementation status. By following this checklist, the project will achieve a more coherent and accurate set of documentation that properly reflects the actual implementation.

The checklist prioritizes the most important areas for consistency checking and provides a clear process for verifying and updating the documentation. It also includes specific items for each component of the system, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all aspects of the project.
