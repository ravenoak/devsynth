## Offline Documentation & Lazy-Loading

### Diagrams

- [x] Create diagrams showing the planned documentation ingestion component

## Consistency Verification Process

1. **Documentation Review**
   - Review all documentation files to ensure they accurately reflect the implementation status
   - Check for inconsistencies between different documentation files
   - Update any outdated information

2. **Code-Documentation Alignment**
   - Verify that the code matches the documentation
   - Check that all documented features are actually implemented
   - Update documentation to match the code where necessary

3. **Behavior Test Alignment**
   - Ensure behavior tests accurately reflect the capabilities of the system
   - Update step definitions to use actual implementations instead of mocks
   - Add tests for any missing features

4. **Diagram Verification**
   - Check that all diagrams accurately represent the system architecture
   - Update diagrams to show the correct relationships between components
   - Add notes about implementation status to diagrams

5. **Final Consistency Check**
   - Perform a final review of all documentation, code, and tests
   - Ensure all inconsistencies have been addressed
   - Update the consistency checklist with the results


## Conclusion

This consistency checklist provides a structured approach to ensuring that all diagrams, pseudocode, behavior files, and other documentation in the DevSynth project are consistent with the updated understanding of the implementation status. By following this checklist, the project will achieve a more coherent and accurate set of documentation that properly reflects the actual implementation.

The checklist prioritizes the most important areas for consistency checking and provides a clear process for verifying and updating the documentation. It also includes specific items for each component of the system, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all aspects of the project.
