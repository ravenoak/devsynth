# Semantic Versioning Policy

DevSynth follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme to communicate changes and compatibility.

## Version Components

- **MAJOR** version when incompatible API changes are introduced.
- **MINOR** version when functionality is added in a backward compatible manner.
- **PATCH** version for backward compatible bug fixes.

## Pre-release Identifiers

Pre-release versions append an identifier after a hyphen (e.g., `1.2.0-alpha`, `2.0.0-rc.1`) to denote milestones that precede a final release.
