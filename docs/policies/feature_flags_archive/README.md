# Feature Flags Archive

This directory indexes feature flags that have been removed from DevSynth.

For each flag, add a `<name>.md` file capturing:
- Flag name: `DEVSYNTH_FEATURE_<NAME>`
- Purpose and scope
- Introduced / Deprecated / Removed dates
- Replacement or unified behavior
- Links to related issues, PRs, and tests

This archive enables traceability and helps downstream users understand changes across versions.
