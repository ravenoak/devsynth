# Data Retention Policy

DevSynth retains data only as long as necessary for active tasks and auditing.

- Memory store items are deleted when tasks complete unless archived.
- Logs are rotated and removed after 30 days.
- Backups of encrypted storage are kept for up to 90 days for disaster recovery.


Users may request early deletion of their data via the project maintainers.
## Implementation Status

This feature is **implemented**.
