# Security Policy

This policy outlines security design principles and operational guidelines for DevSynth.

## Design Guidelines

- Apply the principle of least privilege for all agents and services.
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest where possible.
- Validate all environment variables and configuration inputs on startup.
- Keep dependencies patched and monitor vulnerability advisories.
- Document threat models and mitigations in the architecture docs.


## Operational Guidelines

- Enable or disable authentication, authorization and input sanitization via environment variables (`DEVSYNTH_AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED`, `DEVSYNTH_AUTHORIZATION_ENABLED`, `DEVSYNTH_SANITIZATION_ENABLED`).
- Encryption at rest for memory stores can be toggled with `DEVSYNTH_ENCRYPTION_AT_REST` and a base64 key provided via `DEVSYNTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
- Encryption in transit can be enforced with `DEVSYNTH_ENCRYPTION_IN_TRANSIT`.
- TLS verification and certificates are configured using `DEVSYNTH_TLS_VERIFY`, `DEVSYNTH_TLS_CERT_FILE`, `DEVSYNTH_TLS_KEY_FILE` and `DEVSYNTH_TLS_CA_FILE`.
- Store API keys and secrets in environment variables or a secrets manager; never commit them to the repository.
- Report suspected security issues or vulnerabilities through the issue tracker.
- Review security settings as part of routine cross‑cutting concern audits.
- Maintain logs for security relevant events and restrict access to them.


### Example Configuration

```bash
export DEVSYNTH_ENCRYPTION_AT_REST=true
export DEVSYNTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(python -c 'from devsynth.security.encryption import generate_key; print(generate_key())')"
export DEVSYNTH_TLS_CERT_FILE=/path/to/cert.pem
export DEVSYNTH_TLS_KEY_FILE=/path/to/key.pem
export DEVSYNTH_TLS_CA_FILE=/path/to/ca.pem
export DEVSYNTH_ACCESS_TOKEN=my-secret-token
```

## Automated Audit Procedures and Enforcement

DevSynth automates routine security checks to prevent regressions:

- The `security-audit` CLI command performs dependency vulnerability scans,
  Bandit static analysis, and verifies required security environment variables
  such as `DEVSYNTH_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
- The command exits with a non‑zero status if any check fails, which blocks CI
  pipelines and deployment.
- Developers should run `devsynth security-audit` locally before committing
  changes to catch issues early.

## Incident Response Procedures

The [Incident Response Runbook](../deployment/runbooks/incident_response.md)
describes manual steps for investigating and mitigating production issues.
Automated helpers are provided by `scripts/security_incident_response.py`:

```bash
# Collect logs and run a security audit
python scripts/security_incident_response.py --collect-logs --audit --output incident_$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

This script archives the `logs/` directory and executes the existing
`security-audit` command to aid in forensics.

## Vulnerability Management

Routine patching keeps dependencies up to date. Use
`scripts/vulnerability_management.py` to list outdated packages and optionally
apply updates:

```bash
# Show outdated dependencies
python scripts/vulnerability_management.py

# Apply available updates
python scripts/vulnerability_management.py --apply
```

These checks run in CI alongside `scripts/dependency_safety_check.py` to ensure
the project remains free of known vulnerabilities.

## Threat Model

The primary threats considered include:

- Unauthorized access to memory stores
- Interception of API traffic
- Misuse of agent or API credentials


Mitigations include encryption at rest, optional TLS for all network
communication, bearer token authentication for API and agent actions,
and routine dependency and static analysis checks in CI.
## Implementation Status
Security configuration flags and basic encryption utilities are implemented.
Automated audits and basic monitoring are provided via the
`security-audit` command (also available as `scripts/security_audit.py`).
Memory stores support encryption at rest and emit audit logs for store, retrieve,
and delete operations.
Runtime checks in [`src/devsynth/config/settings.py`](../../src/devsynth/config/settings.py)
validate encryption parameters on startup. The JSON file store implements
AES-based encryption in [`src/devsynth/application/memory/json_file_store.py`](../../src/devsynth/application/memory/json_file_store.py)
using helpers from [`src/devsynth/security/encryption.py`](../../src/devsynth/security/encryption.py).
Security incident response automation is provided via
`scripts/security_incident_response.py`. Dependency updates and vulnerability
checks are handled by `scripts/vulnerability_management.py` alongside the
existing safety and Bandit scans.
