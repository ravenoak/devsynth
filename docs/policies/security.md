# Security Policy

This policy outlines security design principles and operational guidelines for DevSynth.

## Design Guidelines
- Apply the principle of least privilege for all agents and services.
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest where possible.
- Validate all environment variables and configuration inputs on startup.
- Keep dependencies patched and monitor vulnerability advisories.
- Document threat models and mitigations in the architecture docs.

## Operational Guidelines
- Enable or disable authentication, authorization and input sanitization via environment variables (`DEVSYNTH_AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED`, `DEVSYNTH_AUTHORIZATION_ENABLED`, `DEVSYNTH_SANITIZATION_ENABLED`).
- Store API keys and secrets in environment variables or a secrets manager; never commit them to the repository.
- Report suspected security issues or vulnerabilities through the issue tracker.
- Review security settings as part of routine crossâ€‘cutting concern audits.
- Maintain logs for security relevant events and restrict access to them.
