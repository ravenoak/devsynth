# Security Policy

This policy outlines security design principles and operational guidelines for DevSynth.

## Design Guidelines

- Apply the principle of least privilege for all agents and services.
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest where possible.
- Validate all environment variables and configuration inputs on startup.
- Keep dependencies patched and monitor vulnerability advisories.
- Document threat models and mitigations in the architecture docs.


## Operational Guidelines

- Enable or disable authentication, authorization and input sanitization via environment variables (`DEVSYNTH_AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED`, `DEVSYNTH_AUTHORIZATION_ENABLED`, `DEVSYNTH_SANITIZATION_ENABLED`).
- Encryption at rest for memory stores can be toggled with `DEVSYNTH_ENCRYPTION_AT_REST` and a base64 key provided via `DEVSYNTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
- Encryption in transit can be enforced with `DEVSYNTH_ENCRYPTION_IN_TRANSIT`.
- TLS verification and certificates are configured using `DEVSYNTH_TLS_VERIFY`, `DEVSYNTH_TLS_CERT_FILE`, `DEVSYNTH_TLS_KEY_FILE` and `DEVSYNTH_TLS_CA_FILE`.
- Store API keys and secrets in environment variables or a secrets manager; never commit them to the repository.
- Report suspected security issues or vulnerabilities through the issue tracker.
- Review security settings as part of routine crossâ€‘cutting concern audits.
- Maintain logs for security relevant events and restrict access to them.


### Example Configuration

```bash
export DEVSYNTH_ENCRYPTION_AT_REST=true
export DEVSYNTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(python -c 'from devsynth.security.encryption import generate_key; print(generate_key())')"
export DEVSYNTH_TLS_CERT_FILE=/path/to/cert.pem
export DEVSYNTH_TLS_KEY_FILE=/path/to/key.pem
export DEVSYNTH_TLS_CA_FILE=/path/to/ca.pem
export DEVSYNTH_ACCESS_TOKEN=my-secret-token
```

## Threat Model

The primary threats considered include:

- Unauthorized access to memory stores
- Interception of API traffic
- Misuse of agent or API credentials


Mitigations include encryption at rest, optional TLS for all network
communication, bearer token authentication for API and agent actions,
and routine dependency and static analysis checks in CI.
## Implementation Status
Security configuration flags and basic encryption utilities are implemented.
Automated audits and basic monitoring are provided via `scripts/security_audit.py`.
Memory stores support encryption at rest and emit audit logs for store, retrieve,
and delete operations.
