# Cross-Cutting Concerns Policy

This policy defines best practices for security, ethics, access control, and repository structure in DevSynth.

## Key Practices

- Maintain a security policy (`docs/policies/security.md`) and ethical guidelines for AI/LLM use. The security policy details design and operational guidance for authentication, authorization and sanitization settings.
- Document and enforce access control for sensitive operations (deployment, secrets, production data).
- Use a standard directory layout (`src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `deployment/`, etc.) and maintain a repository index (`docs/RepoStructure.md`).
- Annotate code and documentation with requirement IDs, module ownership, and metadata for traceability.
- Use metadata tags/comments for LLM agents (e.g., `@LLM-note`, `# implements REQ-001`).
- Automate knowledge base integration where possible (repo map, semantic search, etc.).
- Schedule regular documentation and policy audits.

## Artifacts

- Security Policy: `docs/policies/security.md` (if present)
- Repo Index: `docs/RepoStructure.md`
- CODEOWNERS: `CODEOWNERS` (if present)
