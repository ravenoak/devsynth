# DevSynth Documentation Review Schedule

## Executive Summary

This document establishes a schedule and process for regular reviews of DevSynth documentation. It defines review frequencies for different types of documentation, assigns responsibilities, and outlines the review process and tracking mechanisms. Regular reviews ensure that documentation remains accurate, up-to-date, and consistent with project standards.

> **Note**: This document uses domain-specific terminology. For definitions of unfamiliar terms, please refer to the [DevSynth Glossary](../glossary.md).

## Review Frequency

Different types of documentation require different review frequencies based on their importance, volatility, and usage. The following schedule defines the minimum review frequency for each type of documentation:

| Documentation Type | Review Frequency | Rationale |
|-------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Core User Documentation | Monthly | High visibility, critical for user experience |
| Developer Guides | Quarterly | Important for contributors, changes with development practices |
| Architecture Documentation | Quarterly | Fundamental understanding, changes with major architectural decisions |
| API Reference | Monthly | Critical for developers, changes with code updates |
| Tutorials and Examples | Quarterly | Important for onboarding, should reflect current workflows |
| Policies and Processes | Bi-annually | Foundational, changes less frequently |
| Roadmap and Planning | Monthly | Strategic direction, changes with project priorities |
| Technical Reference | Quarterly | Detailed information, changes with implementation details |

## Review Responsibilities

Documentation reviews are a shared responsibility across the DevSynth team. The following roles and responsibilities ensure that all documentation is reviewed regularly:

### Documentation Owners

Each documentation file or section has a designated owner responsible for its accuracy and maintenance. Owners are listed in the `author` field in the frontmatter of each document. Owners are responsible for:

- Conducting regular reviews according to the schedule
- Updating content as needed
- Ensuring consistency with style guidelines
- Coordinating with subject matter experts for technical accuracy

### Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)

SMEs provide technical expertise for specific areas of the project. They are responsible for:

- Reviewing technical accuracy of documentation in their area of expertise
- Providing input on technical changes and updates
- Collaborating with documentation owners on complex technical content

### Documentation Coordinator

The Documentation Coordinator oversees the documentation review process and ensures that reviews are conducted according to the schedule. The Coordinator is responsible for:

- Tracking review status and sending reminders
- Facilitating review meetings and discussions
- Updating the review schedule as needed
- Reporting on documentation health and compliance

## Review Process

The documentation review process consists of the following steps:

### 1. Preparation

- The Documentation Coordinator identifies documents due for review based on the schedule
- The Coordinator notifies document owners and relevant SMEs
- Reviewers prepare by familiarizing themselves with the [Documentation Style Guide](../developer_guides/documentation_style_guide.md) and review criteria

### 2. Individual Review

- Document owners review their assigned documents
- SMEs review technical content in their areas of expertise
- Reviewers use the review criteria to evaluate the documentation
- Reviewers document issues, suggestions, and required updates

### 3. Collaborative Review (for complex documents)

- For complex or critical documents, a collaborative review meeting may be scheduled
- Document owners, SMEs, and other stakeholders participate
- The team discusses issues, suggestions, and required updates
- Decisions and action items are documented

### 4. Updates and Revisions

- Document owners make necessary updates based on review findings
- Updates may include content changes, formatting improvements, or structural changes
- All updates should follow the [Documentation Style Guide](../developer_guides/documentation_style_guide.md)

### 5. Verification

- After updates are made, reviewers verify that issues have been addressed
- The Documentation Coordinator confirms that the review is complete
- The `last_reviewed` date in the frontmatter is updated
- The "Last updated" date at the bottom of the document is updated

### 6. Documentation

- The review is documented in the review tracking system
- The review status is updated in the documentation health dashboard
- Any recurring issues or patterns are noted for process improvement

## Review Tracking

Documentation reviews are tracked to ensure compliance with the schedule and to identify patterns or issues that may require process improvements.

### Review Tracking System

Reviews are tracked in the `.devsynth/documentation_reviews.yaml` file, which includes:

- Document path
- Last review date
- Reviewer(s)
- Review status (complete, in progress, overdue)
- Issues identified
- Action items
- Next review date

Example:

```yaml
- document: docs/getting_started/quick_start_guide.md
  last_review_date: 2025-08-02
  reviewers:
    - Jane Smith
    - John Doe
  status: complete
  issues:
    - Command examples need updating
    - Missing reference to new feature
  action_items:
    - Update command examples
    - Add section on new feature
  next_review_date: 2025-09-02
```

### Documentation Health Dashboard

A documentation health dashboard is generated from the review tracking data and provides an overview of:

- Overall documentation health (percentage of documents up-to-date)
- Documents due for review
- Overdue reviews
- Common issues and patterns
- Review compliance by document type

The dashboard is available at `docs/reports/documentation_health.md` and is updated weekly.

## Review Criteria

Documentation reviews evaluate the following criteria:

### 1. Technical Accuracy

- Content is technically accurate and up-to-date
- Code examples work as described
- Command syntax is correct
- API references match the current implementation
- Links to external resources are valid

### 2. Completeness

- All relevant information is included
- No missing sections or topics
- Appropriate level of detail for the target audience
- Examples cover common use cases
- Edge cases and limitations are documented

### 3. Clarity and Readability

- Content is clear and easy to understand
- Language is appropriate for the target audience
- Complex concepts are explained with examples
- Jargon is minimized or explained
- Content is well-organized and flows logically

### 4. Consistency with Style Guidelines

- Formatting follows the [Documentation Style Guide](../developer_guides/documentation_style_guide.md)
- Terminology is consistent with the [DevSynth Glossary](../glossary.md)
- Voice and tone are consistent
- Headings and sections follow the standard structure
- Frontmatter is complete and accurate

### 5. Cross-References and Navigation

- Links to other documents are correct and use relative paths
- Cross-references are appropriate and helpful
- Table of contents is complete and accurate
- Navigation aids (breadcrumbs, related documents) are present
- References to the glossary are included for domain-specific terms

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (August 2025)

- Create the review tracking system
- Assign document owners
- Conduct initial reviews of core user documentation
- Establish the documentation health dashboard

### Phase 2: Full Implementation (September 2025)

- Begin regular reviews according to the schedule
- Conduct training for document owners and reviewers
- Refine the review process based on feedback
- Implement automated reminders for upcoming reviews

### Phase 3: Process Improvement (October 2025 and ongoing)

- Analyze review data to identify patterns and issues
- Refine the review criteria and process
- Implement process improvements
- Adjust review frequencies based on data and feedback
