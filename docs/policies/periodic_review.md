# Periodic Review Process

DevSynth conducts regular policy reviews to ensure guidelines remain accurate,
relevant, and aligned with project objectives.

## Review Schedule

- All policy documents are reviewed at least once per quarter.
- Reviewers are assigned by project maintainers.
- Outcomes are recorded in the corresponding policy files and issue tracker.

## Procedure

1. Collect policies due for review using the documented schedule.
2. Run security and compliance checks, including `bandit` and `safety`.
3. Update the `last_reviewed` front-matter field for each policy.
4. File issues for follow-up actions or required revisions.

## Outcomes

- Updated policies reflecting current practices.
- Audit trail of completed reviews.
