# DevSynth Documentation Ownership

## Executive Summary

This document establishes the ownership model for DevSynth documentation, defining roles, responsibilities, and assignments for different documentation sections. Clear ownership ensures that documentation remains accurate, up-to-date, and consistent with project standards. This document should be used in conjunction with the [Documentation Review Schedule](documentation_review_schedule.md) and [Documentation Style Guide](../developer_guides/documentation_style_guide.md).

> **Note**: This document uses domain-specific terminology. For definitions of unfamiliar terms, please refer to the [DevSynth Glossary](../glossary.md).

## Ownership Model

The DevSynth documentation ownership model is based on the following principles:

1. **Clear Accountability**: Each documentation section has a designated owner who is accountable for its quality and maintenance.
2. **Expertise Alignment**: Owners are assigned based on their expertise and familiarity with the subject matter.
3. **Shared Responsibility**: While owners are accountable, documentation is a collaborative effort with input from multiple contributors.
4. **Transparent Assignments**: Ownership assignments are clearly documented and visible to all team members.
5. **Regular Reviews**: Owners are responsible for conducting regular reviews according to the [Documentation Review Schedule](documentation_review_schedule.md).

### Ownership Roles

The documentation ownership model includes the following roles:

#### Primary Owner

The Primary Owner is accountable for the overall quality, accuracy, and maintenance of a documentation section. They are the main point of contact for questions or issues related to that section.

#### Secondary Owner

The Secondary Owner serves as a backup to the Primary Owner and collaborates on maintaining the documentation section. They step in when the Primary Owner is unavailable and provide additional expertise and perspective.

#### Subject Matter Expert (SME)

SMEs provide specialized knowledge and expertise for specific technical areas. They collaborate with owners to ensure technical accuracy but are not responsible for the overall maintenance of the documentation.

#### Documentation Coordinator

The Documentation Coordinator oversees the entire documentation corpus, ensures adherence to policies and standards, and facilitates collaboration between owners and SMEs. They are responsible for maintaining this ownership document and the [Documentation Review Schedule](documentation_review_schedule.md).

## Owner Responsibilities

Documentation owners have the following responsibilities:

### Primary Owner Responsibilities

1. **Maintenance**: Keep the documentation section up-to-date, accurate, and aligned with the current state of the project.
2. **Regular Reviews**: Conduct reviews according to the [Documentation Review Schedule](documentation_review_schedule.md).
3. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure the documentation follows the [Documentation Style Guide](../developer_guides/documentation_style_guide.md) and meets quality standards.
4. **Issue Resolution**: Address issues, questions, and feedback related to the documentation section.
5. **Collaboration**: Coordinate with SMEs, Secondary Owners, and other contributors to improve the documentation.
6. **Completeness**: Ensure the documentation section covers all necessary topics and provides appropriate detail.
7. **Cross-References**: Maintain appropriate cross-references to related documentation.
8. **Metadata**: Keep frontmatter and metadata up-to-date, including the `last_reviewed` date.

### Secondary Owner Responsibilities

1. **Support**: Assist the Primary Owner in maintaining the documentation section.
2. **Review Participation**: Participate in regular reviews and provide feedback.
3. **Backup Coverage**: Step in when the Primary Owner is unavailable.
4. **Perspective**: Provide additional perspective and expertise to improve the documentation.
5. **Quality Checks**: Help ensure the documentation follows standards and guidelines.

### SME Responsibilities

1. **Technical Accuracy**: Ensure technical content is accurate and up-to-date.
2. **Expert Review**: Review technical aspects of the documentation during regular reviews.
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Share specialized knowledge with owners to improve the documentation.
4. **Technical Updates**: Notify owners when technical changes require documentation updates.

### Documentation Coordinator Responsibilities

1. **Oversight**: Maintain a holistic view of the documentation corpus.
2. **Policy Maintenance**: Keep documentation policies and standards up-to-date.
3. **Coordination**: Facilitate collaboration between owners, SMEs, and other contributors.
4. **Review Tracking**: Track review status and ensure compliance with the review schedule.

## Ownership Transfer Process

When ownership of a documentation section needs to be transferred, the following process should be followed:

### Planned Transfers

1. **Notification**: The current owner notifies the Documentation Coordinator of the planned transfer at least two weeks in advance.
2. **Candidate Identification**: The Documentation Coordinator and current owner identify a suitable new owner based on expertise and availability.
3. **Knowledge Transfer**: The current owner conducts a knowledge transfer session with the new owner, covering:
   - Current state of the documentation
   - Known issues and planned improvements
   - Review history and schedule
   - Key stakeholders and SMEs
4. **Handover Period**: A two-week handover period allows the new owner to become familiar with the documentation while the current owner is still available for questions.
5. **Documentation Update**: The Documentation Coordinator updates this ownership document and notifies relevant stakeholders.
6. **Frontmatter Update**: The new owner updates the `author` field in the frontmatter of the documentation files.

### Unplanned Transfers

1. **Interim Assignment**: If an owner becomes unavailable unexpectedly, the Secondary Owner temporarily assumes ownership.
2. **Coordinator Notification**: The Secondary Owner notifies the Documentation Coordinator of the situation.
3. **Permanent Assignment**: If the original owner will be unavailable for an extended period, the Documentation Coordinator initiates the process to assign a new permanent owner.
4. **Documentation Update**: The Documentation Coordinator updates this ownership document and notifies relevant stakeholders.

## Collaboration Guidelines

Effective documentation requires collaboration between owners, SMEs, and other contributors. The following guidelines facilitate productive collaboration:

### Communication Channels

- **Documentation Issues**: Use GitHub issues with the "documentation" label for tracking documentation-related tasks and issues.
- **Review Discussions**: Conduct documentation review discussions in dedicated meetings or in comments on review pull requests.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Use the team wiki or shared documents for knowledge sharing and documentation planning.

### Contribution Process

1. **Issue Creation**: Anyone can create an issue to suggest documentation improvements or report problems.
2. **Owner Review**: The section owner reviews the issue and determines the appropriate action.
3. **Contribution**: Contributors can submit pull requests with proposed changes.
4. **Owner Approval**: The section owner reviews and approves changes before they are merged.
5. **SME Consultation**: For technical changes, the owner consults with relevant SMEs to ensure accuracy.

### Collaborative Editing

For significant updates or new documentation, a collaborative editing process is recommended:

1. **Planning**: The owner creates an outline and shares it with relevant stakeholders.
2. **Draft Creation**: The owner or designated contributors create an initial draft.
3. **Review Round**: SMEs and other stakeholders review the draft and provide feedback.
4. **Revision**: The owner incorporates feedback and revises the draft.
5. **Final Review**: A final review ensures the documentation meets quality standards.
6. **Publication**: The owner publishes the documentation and updates relevant cross-references.

## Implementation Timeline
