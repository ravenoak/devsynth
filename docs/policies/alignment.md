## Introduction

Alignment between SDLC artifacts is essential for ensuring that the final product meets its requirements and that all stakeholders have a consistent understanding of the system. This guide provides a comprehensive framework for maintaining alignment throughout the development lifecycle.

## Core Principles

### 1. Bidirectional Traceability

All artifacts should maintain bidirectional traceability:

- Requirements should trace forward to specifications, tests, and code
- Code, tests, and specifications should trace backward to requirements
- Changes to any artifact should trigger a review of related artifacts


### 2. Consistent Terminology

Consistent terminology should be used across all artifacts:

- Use the glossary of terms defined in the project documentation
- Avoid introducing new terms without updating the glossary
- Maintain consistent capitalization and naming conventions


### 3. Synchronized Updates

When updating an artifact, related artifacts should be updated in sync:

- When a requirement changes, update related specifications, tests, and code
- When implementing code, ensure it aligns with specifications and tests
- When writing tests, verify they match specifications and requirements


### 4. Minimal Redundancy

Avoid unnecessary duplication of information across artifacts:

- Reference existing artifacts rather than duplicating content
- When duplication is necessary, ensure consistent mechanisms for keeping copies in sync
- Use templates and standardized formats to ensure consistency


## Alignment Guidelines

### Artifact-Specific Guidelines

#### Requirements

1. **Identification**: Each requirement should have a unique identifier (e.g., FR-01, NFR-02)
2. **Specification Links**: Requirements should explicitly reference related specifications
3. **Verification Method**: Requirements should specify how they will be verified (test, inspection, demonstration)
4. **Status Tracking**: Requirements should include status information (proposed, approved, implemented, verified)


#### Specifications

1. **Requirement References**: Specifications should reference the requirements they fulfill
2. **Test Coverage**: Specifications should indicate expected test coverage
3. **Implementation Notes**: Specifications should include notes for implementers
4. **Design Decisions**: Specifications should document design decisions and alternatives considered


#### Tests

1. **Specification References**: Tests should reference the specifications they verify
2. **Requirement Coverage**: Tests should indicate which requirements they verify
3. **Test Data**: Tests should include or reference necessary test data
4. **Edge Cases**: Tests should cover normal paths, edge cases, and error conditions


#### Code

1. **Test References**: Code should reference related tests
2. **Specification Conformance**: Code should conform to specifications
3. **Requirement Fulfillment**: Code should fulfill requirements
4. **Documentation**: Code should include documentation that references specifications and requirements


### Alignment Verification Process

#### Pre-Implementation

Before implementing a feature:

1. Review related requirements and specifications
2. Verify that requirements have corresponding specifications
3. Verify that specifications have corresponding test plans
4. Identify any inconsistencies or gaps


#### During Implementation

While implementing a feature:

1. Regularly check alignment with specifications
2. Update tests as implementation details are refined
3. Document any deviations from specifications
4. Keep a record of design decisions


#### Post-Implementation

After implementing a feature:

1. Verify that all requirements are fulfilled
2. Verify that implementation matches specifications
3. Verify that tests cover all aspects of the implementation
4. Update documentation to reflect the final implementation
