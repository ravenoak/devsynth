# Maintenance Policy

This policy defines best practices for ongoing support, updates, and knowledge continuity in DevSynth.

## Key Practices
- Maintain a maintenance plan in `docs/maintenance_plan.md` (release/versioning, update schedule, deprecated features).
- Use issue tracking and triage conventions; assign/label issues to avoid duplicate work.
- Require documentation updates with all code/feature changes.
- Maintain a changelog (`CHANGELOG.md`) and follow semantic versioning.
- Schedule regular refactoring and technical debt management.
- Document dependency update procedures and test requirements.
- Provide handoff/retirement procedures for agents/components.

## Artifacts
- Maintenance Plan: `docs/maintenance_plan.md`
- Changelog: `CHANGELOG.md`
- Issue Templates: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
- Dependency Files: `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`

## References
- See [Deployment Policy](deployment.md) for release/rollback.
