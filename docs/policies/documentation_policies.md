# Documentation Policies

This document outlines the comprehensive policies for maintaining high-quality documentation in the DevSynth project. It serves as the central reference point for all documentation-related policies and guidelines.

## Overview

DevSynth documentation follows a structured approach to ensure consistency, clarity, and usability across all documentation artifacts. These policies apply to all documentation in the project, including README files, user guides, developer documentation, technical references, and specifications.

## Core Documentation Principles

1. **Clarity**: Documentation should be clear, concise, and easy to understand
2. **Completeness**: Documentation should cover all necessary aspects of the subject
3. **Consistency**: Documentation should maintain consistent style, terminology, and structure
4. **Currency**: Documentation should be kept up-to-date with the latest changes
5. **Accessibility**: Documentation should be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities

## Documentation Structure

The DevSynth documentation is organized into the following directories:

- `getting_started/` – Quick start, installation, and basic usage
- `user_guides/` – User guide, CLI reference, configuration
- `developer_guides/` – Contributing, development setup, testing, code style
- `architecture/` – System, agent, memory, and reasoning architecture
- `technical_reference/` – API, error handling, performance
- `analysis/` – Project analysis, executive summary, critical recommendations
- `implementation/` – Implementation status, feature matrix, assessments
- `specifications/` – Current and archived specifications
- `roadmap/` – Roadmaps and improvement plans
- `policies/` – SDLC, security, testing, and maintenance policies

Each directory should contain an `index.md` file that provides an overview of the contents and links to the individual documents.

## Specification and Test Alignment

- Draft a specification in `docs/specifications/` before implementing changes.
- Add a failing BDD feature in `tests/behavior/features/` prior to writing code.
- Keep documentation, specifications, and tests synchronized as the project evolves.

## Detailed Policy Areas

DevSynth maintains detailed policies for specific aspects of documentation:

### Style Guide

The [Documentation Style Guide](documentation_style_guide.md) provides comprehensive guidelines for:

- Document structure and frontmatter
- Writing style, voice, and tone
- Formatting conventions
- Code examples
- Links and references
- Admonitions and callouts
- Images and diagrams
- Tables
- Terminology
- File organization

All documentation should adhere to these style guidelines to ensure consistency across the project.

### Review Process

The [Documentation Review Process](documentation_review_process.md) outlines:

- Review criteria and checklist
- Review workflow and responsibilities
- Approval process
- Feedback incorporation
- Quality metrics

All documentation changes must go through this review process before being merged.

### User Testing

The [Documentation User Testing](documentation_user_testing.md) policy covers:

- User testing methodologies
- Test participant selection
- Test scenario design
- Feedback collection and analysis
- Iterative improvement process

Regular user testing ensures that documentation meets user needs and expectations.

### Version Management

The [Documentation Version Management](documentation_version_management.md) policy details:

- Version numbering scheme
- Version compatibility mapping
- Archiving procedures
- Deprecation notices
- Migration guides

This ensures that users can find documentation relevant to their specific version of DevSynth.

## Review Process

- All documentation changes must be reviewed for accuracy, clarity, and consistency
- Use pull requests for documentation updates
- Follow the detailed review process outlined in [Documentation Review Process](documentation_review_process.md)

## Testing Documentation

- All code and usage examples in documentation must be tested and verified
- Outdated or incorrect examples should be updated or removed
- Follow the testing procedures outlined in [Documentation User Testing](documentation_user_testing.md)

## Versioning

- Clearly mark documentation that applies to specific versions
- Maintain a changelog for major documentation updates
- Follow the versioning guidelines in [Documentation Version Management](documentation_version_management.md)

## Style Guide

- Follow the [Documentation Style Guide](documentation_style_guide.md) for all documentation
- Use consistent formatting and structure in all documentation
- Follow the [Code Style Guide](../developer_guides/code_style.md) for code examples

## Audits

- Conduct regular documentation audits to identify outdated or missing content
- Schedule audits at least once per release cycle
- Use the [consistency checklist](consistency_checklist.md) for audits

## Templates

- Use documentation templates for new guides, references, and policies
- Templates can be found in the [metadata_template.md](../metadata_template.md) file

## Cross-Linking

- Ensure all documents are cross-linked for easy navigation
- Include a "Related Documents" section in each document
- Use relative links for internal documentation

## Contributor Training

- Train new contributors on documentation best practices
- Reference this policy in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Provide examples of well-documented code and features

## Implementation and Enforcement

These policies are enforced through:

1. Automated checks in the CI/CD pipeline
2. Pull request reviews
3. Regular documentation audits
4. Feedback from users and contributors
