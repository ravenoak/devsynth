# Adapter Strict Typing PR Plan

## Purpose
This roadmap decomposes the adapter strict-typing initiative into focused pull requests. Each PR targets a single adapter module, hardens its typing with Protocol/DataClass annotations, and ensures `mypy --strict` plus ≥60% unit-test coverage. The structure follows dialectical and Socratic best practices: we pose key questions, examine opposing constraints, and document decisive steps before implementation.

## Shared Guardrails (apply to every PR)
- **Socratic prompts:**
  - *What contract does this adapter expose (inputs/outputs, side effects)?*
  - *Which types remain uncertain, and what evidence resolves them?*
  - *How do we prove the adapter behaves under error conditions without real back-ends?*
- **Dialectical checkpoints:** capture trade-offs between precision and pragmatism (e.g., typed Protocol vs. runtime ABC) in code comments or PR notes when decisions affect downstream callers.
- **Implementation checklist:**
  1. Introduce typed DTOs/Protocols for external interactions and ensure serialization helpers use explicit schemas.
  2. Replace `Any` and implicit unions with concrete types (TypedDict, dataclasses, enums) and tighten exception flows.
  3. Add `tests/unit/adapters/test_<module>.py` cases covering happy-path request shaping, serialization round-trips, and representative error handling using fakes or fixtures; gate optional resources via `@pytest.mark.requires_resource`.
  4. Run `poetry run mypy --strict <module>` until clean, then execute `poetry run devsynth run-tests --target unit-tests --speed=fast --no-parallel --cov-report=term` and confirm module-specific coverage ≥60% (use coverage JSON helpers if needed).
  5. Remove the module from the adapter override block in `pyproject.toml` and append evidence to `docs/typing/strictness.md` plus `docs/tasks.md §29.4`.
