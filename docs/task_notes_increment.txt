# Task Notes Increment â€” Iteration 7 (2025-09-02 11:09 local)

Scope:
- Formalize troubleshooting quick path as complete (Task 15) since all sub-items are already satisfied and evidence captured.
- Run ReqID docstring verification to baseline gaps for Task 13; do not mark complete yet.

Actions:
- Marked Task 15 parent checkbox as [x] in docs/tasks.md; sub-items were already [x].
- Executed: poetry run python scripts/verify_docstring_reqids.py --report --report-file diagnostics/test_reqids_report.json
  - Exit code: 1 (851 tests missing 'ReqID:')
  - Artifacts: diagnostics/test_reqids_report.json; appended to diagnostics/exec_log.txt via scripts/append_exec_log.py.

Evidence:
- diagnostics/fast_smoke_run.txt, diagnostics/pytest_version.txt, diagnostics/pip_list.txt, diagnostics/utc_timestamp.txt (previous iterations) cover Task 15.
- diagnostics/test_reqids_report.json captures Task 13 baseline.

Next:
- Plan targeted updates to high-visibility tests to add "ReqID:" tags incrementally and integrate verify:reqids into pre-commit for changed test files.
- Keep alignment with docs/plan.md and .junie/guidelines.md.
