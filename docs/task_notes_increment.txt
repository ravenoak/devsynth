Iteration: 2025-09-05 23:22 local
Scope: Phase 4 – implement coverage regression guard (Task 6.3)

Changes
- Added scripts/compare_coverage.py: compares base vs PR coverage.json and exits non-zero if drop > allowed (default 1.0pp).
- Marked docs/tasks.md 6.3 as [x].

Validation
- Dry-run examples (manual reasoning):
  - If base totals.percent_covered=88.5 and PR=88.0 with allow-drop=1.0 → success, exit 0.
  - If base=88.5 and PR=86.9 → failure (drop=1.6pp), exit 3.
- Parser supports common coverage.py JSON formats: totals.percent_covered, totals.percent_covered_display, or computed covered_lines/num_statements.

Notes / Alignment
- Aligns with docs/plan.md Phase 4 (regression guard) and .junie/guidelines.md: deterministic, CLI-friendly, clear exit codes.
- CI wiring remains pending (Task 8.x) and will be addressed in a separate iteration; today we only provide the script deliverable.

Next Targets
- Evaluate feasibility of 7.1 (dead code and unused type: ignore removal in run_tests_cmd.py).
- If coverage on main ≥85% in CI, proceed to 6.1; otherwise document blocker.
