# DevSynth v0.1.0a1 Release Tasks

## Executive Summary

This document enumerates all specific, actionable tasks required to achieve v0.1.0a1 release readiness. Tasks are organized by priority with clear acceptance criteria, dependencies, and parallel execution opportunities.

**Status**: READY FOR EXECUTION
**Total Tasks**: 24 individual tasks across 6 task groups
**Timeline**: 4-week phased approach
**Quality Gates**: All tasks must pass validation criteria before release

## Task Organization and Dependencies

### Task Order Sensitivity Analysis
**YES** - Tasks have explicit implementation sequence requirements due to:
- **Foundation Dependencies**: MyPy compliance and core coverage must precede advanced work
- **Quality Gate Progression**: Each task group builds upon previous validation
- **Risk Mitigation**: Critical blockers resolved before quality enhancements

### Implementation Sequence
1. **Week 1**: Foundation (Groups 1-2) - Establish core quality gates
2. **Week 2**: Quality Assurance (Groups 3-4) - Align specifications and resolve audits
3. **Week 3**: Final Preparation (Groups 5-6) - Synchronize tracking and prepare distribution
4. **Week 4**: Validation and Release - Execute quality gates and tag release

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- **Within Task Groups**: Most subtasks within a group can execute in parallel
- **Cross-Group Parallelism**: Groups 1+2, 3+4, and 5+6 can have limited parallel execution
- **Independent Tasks**: Repository hygiene can proceed alongside other work

### Critical Dependencies
- **MyPy Compliance** → All other development work (blocks quality gates)
- **Core Coverage (70%)** → Release qualification (UAT requirement)
- **Behavior Test Alignment** → Dialectical audit resolution (test-doc linkage)
- **Audit Resolution** → Issue tracker sync (documentation completeness)

## Task Execution Guidelines

### Parallel Execution Matrix
| Task Group | Can Parallel With | Notes |
|------------|-------------------|--------|
| Group 1 | Group 2 (after foundation) | MyPy fixes don't block coverage analysis |
| Group 2 | Group 1 | Coverage work independent of type fixes |
| Group 3 | Group 4 | Spec review can proceed alongside audit categorization |
| Group 4 | Group 3 | Audit work can proceed alongside spec validation |
| Group 5 | Group 6 | Issue sync can proceed alongside repository cleanup |
| Group 6 | Groups 3-5 | Hygiene work largely independent |

### Risk Mitigation
- **Daily Checkpoints**: Run validation after each task completion
- **Rollback Plan**: Git branches for each task group allow isolated rollback
- **Quality Gates**: No advancement without passing acceptance criteria
- **Evidence Collection**: All artifacts preserved for audit trail

### Success Metrics Tracking
- **Quantitative**: MyPy (4→0 errors), Coverage (23.9%→≥70%), Audit (200+→0 critical)
- **Qualitative**: Specification alignment, documentation completeness, repository hygiene
- **Validation**: All pre-release checklist items completed successfully

This comprehensive task breakdown ensures systematic, quality-assured progression toward v0.1.0a1 release readiness while maintaining DevSynth's architectural integrity and development standards.
