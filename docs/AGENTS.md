# AGENTS.md

This directory hosts DevSynth documentation.

- Run the environment provisioning script before editing documentation.
- Follow the specification-first BDD workflow: capture new requirements in `specifications/` and pair them with a failing BDD feature in `../tests/behavior/features/` before implementation.
- Documentation updates must follow the [Documentation Policies](policies/documentation_policies.md) and the [Dialectical Audit Policy](policies/dialectical_audit.md).

## External Resources

- Treat `inspirational_docs/` as brainstorming material only; do not reference these files directly.
- Papers in `external_research_papers/` may be cited using standard academic best practices.
