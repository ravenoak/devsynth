# AGENTS.md

This directory hosts DevSynth documentation.

- follow the specification-first BDD workflow: capture new requirements in `specifications/` and pair them with a failing BDD feature in `../tests/behavior/features/` before implementation;
- honor the [Documentation Policies](policies/documentation_policies.md), the [Dialectical Audit Policy](policies/dialectical_audit.md), and all guidelines under `policies/`; resolve `dialectical_audit.log` before submitting a PR;
- update this file when documentation workflows change.

## External Resources

- Treat `inspirational_docs/` as brainstorming material only; do not reference these files directly.
- Papers in `external_research_papers/` may be cited using standard academic best practices.
