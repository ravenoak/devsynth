# Multi-disciplinary Dialectical Reasoning

Feature: Multi-disciplinary Dialectical Reasoning

WSDE teams merge perspectives across disciplines to refine solutions.

!!! warning "Implementation status: Partial"
    - The "Finalize dialectical reasoning" issue remains in progress and still calls out missing workflow integration, consensus failure handling, and broader test coverage for this reasoning loop.【F:issues/Finalize-dialectical-reasoning.md†L1-L40】
    - The feature status matrix lists WSDE agent collaboration—including the multi-disciplinary reasoning utilities—as partial, with remaining validation tracked through the open WSDE collaboration issues.【F:docs/implementation/feature_status_matrix.md†L51-L107】
    - The release plan’s dependency matrix treats the WSDE collaboration stack as a release-blocking remediation stream, ensuring the outstanding dialectical proofs land before the 0.1.0 hardening phase.【F:docs/plan.md†L305-L309】
