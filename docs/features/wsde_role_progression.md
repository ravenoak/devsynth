# WSDE Role Progression and Memory Flush

DevSynth exposes WSDE role assignments through agent identifiers. When an
EDRR phase transition occurs, `progress_roles` reassigns roles and uses
`flush_memory_queue` to commit pending memory items so subsequent phases see a
consistent state.

This feature is exercised in `tests/behavior/features/wsde/collaboration_flow.feature`.
