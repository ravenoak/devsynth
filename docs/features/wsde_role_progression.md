# WSDE Role Progression and Memory Flush

DevSynth exposes WSDE role assignments through agent identifiers. When an
EDRR phase transition occurs, `progress_roles` reassigns roles and uses
`flush_memory_queue` to commit pending memory items so subsequent phases see a
consistent state.

This feature is exercised in `tests/behavior/features/wsde/collaboration_flow.feature`.

!!! warning "Implementation status: Blocked"
    - The "Finalize WSDE/EDRR workflow logic" issue remains blocked because integration suites still hang inside the collaboration memory utilities, so the end-to-end role progression workflow is incomplete.【F:issues/Finalize-WSDE-EDRR-workflow-logic.md†L1-L40】
    - The feature status matrix continues to classify WSDE agent collaboration as partial, with remediation linked to the same blocked issues and archived failure reports.【F:docs/implementation/feature_status_matrix.md†L51-L107】
    - The release plan’s dependency matrix highlights the WSDE collaboration backlog as a release-blocking remediation stream, keeping these fixes on the critical path to 0.1.0.【F:docs/plan.md†L305-L309】
