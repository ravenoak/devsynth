# MVU shell command execution

Feature: MVU shell command execution

The MVU CLI runs shell commands within a traceable session.

!!! warning "Implementation status: In progress"
    - The outstanding "MVU Command Execution" issue covers the shell execution workflow as well, noting that the behaviour described here still needs implementation and executable coverage.【F:issues/mvu-command-execution.md†L1-L23】
    - The 0.1.0 release roadmap keeps MVUU engine and command tooling on the milestone plan, so this shell workflow remains part of the tracked remediation scope.【F:docs/roadmap/release_plan.md†L70-L75】
