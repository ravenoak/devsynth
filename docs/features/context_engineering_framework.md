# Context Engineering Framework Feature

## Overview

The Context Engineering Framework transforms DevSynth's memory and context management from passive storage systems into active, intelligent context curation that optimizes LLM performance. This feature implements the principles from advanced LLM context management research, shifting from maximizing context size to optimizing context utility.

## Problem Statement

DevSynth's current memory architecture provides comprehensive storage but lacks sophisticated techniques for managing the LLM's "attention budget." Agents struggle with context rot, lost-in-the-middle problems, and inefficient information utilization, leading to degraded performance on complex tasks.

## Solution

Implement a comprehensive context engineering framework that includes:

- **RAG+ Integration**: Dual corpus architecture for reasoning-aware retrieval
- **Semantic-Anchor Compression**: High-fidelity context compression without autoencoding drawbacks
- **Hierarchical Context Stacks**: Organized information layers for optimal attention allocation
- **Agentic Memory Management**: Autonomous context curation and self-improvement capabilities

## Key Capabilities

### Attention Budget Management
- Treat context as a finite resource with diminishing marginal returns
- Track and optimize token utilization across tasks
- Measure signal-to-noise ratios for context quality assessment

### Dual Corpus RAG+
- Knowledge corpus for factual information retrieval
- Application examples corpus for procedural guidance
- Joint retrieval that provides both "what" and "how-to" information

### Context Transformation
- Semantic-Anchor Compression for high-fidelity reduction
- Hierarchical summarization for extreme context lengths
- Format optimization for better model comprehension

### Agentic Self-Management
- Compaction: Periodic summarization of conversation history
- Structured note-taking: External scratchpad for progress tracking
- Sub-agent architectures: Hierarchical task decomposition

## User Benefits

### For Developers
- Improved agent performance on complex, multi-step tasks
- Reduced context-related failures and hallucinations
- More efficient use of computational resources

### For DevSynth Users
- Better code generation and analysis capabilities
- Enhanced reasoning in complex software engineering tasks
- Improved long-horizon task completion rates

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Changes

```python
class ContextEngineeringManager:
    """Orchestrates context engineering across the system."""

    def __init__(self, memory_manager, context_manager):
        self.memory_manager = memory_manager
        self.context_manager = context_manager
        self.rag_plus = RAGPlusSystem()
        self.compression_engine = SemanticAnchorCompression()
        self.agentic_memory = AgenticMemoryManager()

    def optimize_context(self, task_context, available_budget):
        """Apply context engineering techniques to optimize for task."""
        # Retrieve relevant knowledge and examples
        knowledge, examples = self.rag_plus.retrieve(task_context)

        # Compress if necessary
        if self._exceeds_budget(knowledge + examples):
            compressed = self.compression_engine.compress(
                knowledge + examples, target_ratio=0.3
            )

        # Structure into hierarchical stack
        hierarchical_context = self._build_hierarchical_stack(
            global_context=task_context.get('globals', {}),
            dynamic_context=compressed,
            episodic_context=task_context.get('history', [])
        )

        return hierarchical_context
```

### Integration Points

- Enhances agent workflows with metacognitive features

#### With WSDE Model
- **Primus**: Full context engineering orchestration capabilities
- **Worker**: Task-specific context optimization
- **Supervisor**: Quality monitoring of context decisions
- **Designer**: Enhanced reasoning with application examples
- **Evaluator**: Context-aware quality assessment

#### With EDRR Framework
- **Expand**: RAG+ for diverse approaches and examples
- **Differentiate**: Structured comparison with agentic note-taking
- **Refine**: Compression and optimization for iterative improvement
- **Retrospect**: Meta-learning from context engineering outcomes

## Quality Assurance

### Metrics
- **Context Utility Score**: Measure of information relevance and usefulness
- **Compression Fidelity**: Semantic preservation during reduction
- **Retrieval Precision**: Accuracy of knowledge-example matching
- **Task Completion Improvement**: Performance gains on complex tasks

### Testing
