# DevSynth Feature Status Matrix

This document provides a comprehensive status matrix for all features in the DevSynth project. It is a key deliverable of the Feature Implementation Audit conducted as part of Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization.

## Status Categories

Features are categorized according to their implementation status:

- **Fully Implemented (100%)**: Feature is completely implemented and tested
- **Partially Implemented (X%)**: Feature is partially implemented, with percentage indicating completion level
- **Documented Only (0%)**: Feature is documented but not implemented
- **Undocumented but Implemented**: Feature is implemented but not documented

## Impact and Complexity Scoring

Each feature is scored on two dimensions:

- **User Impact (1-5)**: How important the feature is to users
  - 1: Minimal impact, not directly visible to users
  - 3: Moderate impact, enhances user experience
  - 5: Critical impact, core functionality users depend on

- **Implementation Complexity (1-5)**: How complex the feature is to implement
  - 1: Simple implementation, few dependencies
  - 3: Moderate complexity, some dependencies
  - 5: Highly complex, many dependencies or technical challenges

## Feature Status Table

| Feature | Status | User Impact (1-5) | Implementation Complexity (1-5) | Dependencies | Owner | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|-------|-------|
| **Core Framework** |
| EDRR Framework | Partially Implemented (60%) | 5 | 4 | Agent Orchestration | | Core phase transitions implemented, advanced features pending |
| WSDE Agent Collaboration | Partially Implemented (40%) | 4 | 5 | Memory System | | Basic collaboration working, advanced features pending |
| Dialectical Reasoning | Partially Implemented (50%) | 4 | 3 | WSDE Model | | Framework defined, implementation in progress |
| Memory System | Fully Implemented (100%) | 5 | 4 | None | | Complete with ChromaDB integration |
| LLM Provider System | Fully Implemented (100%) | 5 | 3 | None | | Multiple backend support implemented |
| **User-Facing Features** |
| CLI Interface | Fully Implemented (100%) | 5 | 2 | None | | All commands implemented and tested |
| Project Initialization | Fully Implemented (100%) | 5 | 2 | None | | Complete with configuration options |
| Code Generation | Partially Implemented (70%) | 5 | 5 | AST Analysis | | Basic generation working, advanced features pending |
| Test Generation | Partially Implemented (60%) | 4 | 4 | Code Generation | | Unit test generation working, integration tests pending |
| Documentation Generation | Partially Implemented (40%) | 3 | 3 | Code Analysis | | Basic documentation generation implemented |
| **Infrastructure Components** |
| Docker Containerization | Fully Implemented (100%) | 4 | 3 | None | | Dockerfile and Compose provided |
| Configuration Management | Partially Implemented (70%) | 4 | 3 | None | | Environment-specific templates available |
| Deployment Automation | Partially Implemented (50%) | 3 | 3 | Docker | | Basic Docker Compose workflows |
| Security Framework | Documented Only (0%) | 4 | 4 | None | | Planned for Month 3 implementation |
| Dependency Management | Partially Implemented (30%) | 3 | 2 | None | | Basic management implemented, optimization pending |

## Current Limitations and Workarounds

### EDRR Framework Limitations
- **Limitation**: Advanced phase transitions not fully implemented
- **Workaround**: Manually guide the system through phases using explicit commands

### WSDE Agent Collaboration Limitations
- **Limitation**: Dynamic role assignment not fully implemented
- **Workaround**: Assign roles explicitly in configuration

### Code Generation Limitations
- **Limitation**: Complex code structures may not generate correctly
- **Workaround**: Break down complex requirements into smaller, more manageable pieces

## Next Steps

1. Complete the comprehensive audit of all 83 documentation files against implementation
2. Update this matrix with findings from the complete audit
3. Prioritize incomplete features based on user impact and implementation complexity
4. Develop detailed implementation plans for high-priority features
