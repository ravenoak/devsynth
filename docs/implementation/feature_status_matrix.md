# DevSynth Feature Status Matrix

This document provides a comprehensive status matrix for all features in the DevSynth project. It is a key deliverable of the Feature Implementation Audit conducted as part of Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization.

**Implementation Status:** The overall project is **partially implemented**. Approximately **77%** of documented features are functional. Work continues toward the `0.1.0-alpha.1` milestone, but several integration tests remain unstable. Each feature row below lists the current completion level and outstanding work.

## Status Categories

Features are categorized according to their implementation status:

- **Complete**: Feature is completely implemented and tested
- **Partial**: Feature is implemented but missing some functionality or polish
- **Missing**: Feature is documented but not implemented


## Impact and Complexity Scoring

Each feature is scored on two dimensions:

- **User Impact (1-5)**: How important the feature is to users
  - 1: Minimal impact, not directly visible to users
  - 3: Moderate impact, enhances user experience
  - 5: Critical impact, core functionality users depend on

- **Implementation Complexity (1-5)**: How complex the feature is to implement
  - 1: Simple implementation, few dependencies
  - 3: Moderate complexity, some dependencies
  - 5: Highly complex, many dependencies or technical challenges

## Current Limitations and Workarounds

### EDRR Framework Limitations

- **Limitation**: Monitoring and debugging tools are still basic
- **Workaround**: Enable enhanced logging for detailed tracing


### WSDE Agent Collaboration Limitations

- **Limitation**: Consensus algorithms are stable but require ongoing validation
- **Workaround**: Review major decisions manually until stable


### Code Generation Limitations

- **Limitation**: Complex code structures may not generate correctly
- **Workaround**: Break down complex requirements into smaller, more manageable pieces

### Memory System Limitations

- **Limitation**: Adapters without native transactions use in-memory snapshots for rollback
- **Workaround**: Prefer LMDB when strict durability is required


## Next Steps

1. Address gaps identified during the documentation audit
2. Keep this matrix updated as features progress toward completion
3. Prioritize incomplete features based on user impact and implementation complexity
4. Develop detailed implementation plans for high-priority features

Current partial implementations include the EDRR framework, WSDE agent collaboration, memory synchronization utilities, deployment automation, the retry mechanism, and the SDLC security policy. A recent fast test run produced **0** failing tests, **51** passing tests, and **30** skipped with **0** collection errors. Test metrics identify **3,309** tests across the suite—approximately **2,024** unit, **346** integration, **43** behavior, **12** performance, and **2** property test functions—with overall coverage at **19%**. Unfinished WSDE collaboration features and cross-store memory integration remain the primary sources of instability, blocking `0.1.0-alpha.1`.


## Release Milestones and Coverage Goals

DevSynth releases follow the [Release Plan](../roadmap/release_plan.md). Each milestone has an associated target for automated test coverage:

| Milestone | Coverage Target | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| `0.1.0-alpha.1` | ~50% | Core architecture validated |
| `0.1.0-alpha.1` | ≥75% | Peer review workflow and Web UI preview |
| `0.1.0-rc.1` | ≥90% | Documentation freeze and full suite passing |

Coverage goals align with the [Testing Standards](../developer_guides/TESTING_STANDARDS.md). Advancing to the next milestone requires meeting the stated coverage threshold.
