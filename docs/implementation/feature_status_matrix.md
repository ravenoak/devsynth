# DevSynth Feature Status Matrix

This document provides a comprehensive status matrix for all features in the DevSynth project. It is a key deliverable of the Feature Implementation Audit conducted as part of Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization.

**Implementation Status:** The overall project is **partially implemented**. Each feature row below lists the current completion level and outstanding work.

## Status Categories

Features are categorized according to their implementation status:

- **Fully Implemented (100%)**: Feature is completely implemented and tested
- **Partially Implemented (X%)**: Feature is partially implemented, with percentage indicating completion level
- **Documented Only (0%)**: Feature is documented but not implemented
- **Undocumented but Implemented**: Feature is implemented but not documented

## Impact and Complexity Scoring

Each feature is scored on two dimensions:

- **User Impact (1-5)**: How important the feature is to users
  - 1: Minimal impact, not directly visible to users
  - 3: Moderate impact, enhances user experience
  - 5: Critical impact, core functionality users depend on

- **Implementation Complexity (1-5)**: How complex the feature is to implement
  - 1: Simple implementation, few dependencies
  - 3: Moderate complexity, some dependencies
  - 5: Highly complex, many dependencies or technical challenges

## Feature Status Table

## Current Limitations and Workarounds

### EDRR Framework Limitations
- **Limitation**: Monitoring and debugging tools are still basic
- **Workaround**: Enable enhanced logging for detailed tracing

### WSDE Agent Collaboration Limitations
- **Limitation**: Consensus algorithms require additional validation
- **Workaround**: Review major decisions manually until stable

### Code Generation Limitations
- **Limitation**: Complex code structures may not generate correctly
- **Workaround**: Break down complex requirements into smaller, more manageable pieces

## Next Steps

1. Complete the comprehensive audit of all 83 documentation files against implementation
2. Update this matrix with findings from the complete audit
3. Prioritize incomplete features based on user impact and implementation complexity
4. Develop detailed implementation plans for high-priority features
