# DevSynth Feature Status Matrix

This document provides a comprehensive status matrix for all features in the DevSynth project. It is a key deliverable of the Feature Implementation Audit conducted as part of Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization.

**Implementation Status:** The overall project is **partially implemented**. Each feature row below lists the current completion level and outstanding work.

## Status Categories

Features are categorized according to their implementation status:

- **Complete**: Feature is completely implemented and tested
- **Partial**: Feature is implemented but missing some functionality or polish
- **Missing**: Feature is documented but not implemented


## Impact and Complexity Scoring

Each feature is scored on two dimensions:

- **User Impact (1-5)**: How important the feature is to users
  - 1: Minimal impact, not directly visible to users
  - 3: Moderate impact, enhances user experience
  - 5: Critical impact, core functionality users depend on

- **Implementation Complexity (1-5)**: How complex the feature is to implement
  - 1: Simple implementation, few dependencies
  - 3: Moderate complexity, some dependencies
  - 5: Highly complex, many dependencies or technical challenges

## Current Limitations and Workarounds

### EDRR Framework Limitations

- **Limitation**: Monitoring and debugging tools are still basic
- **Workaround**: Enable enhanced logging for detailed tracing


### WSDE Agent Collaboration Limitations

- **Limitation**: Consensus algorithms are stable but require ongoing validation
- **Workaround**: Review major decisions manually until stable


### Code Generation Limitations

- **Limitation**: Complex code structures may not generate correctly
- **Workaround**: Break down complex requirements into smaller, more manageable pieces


## Next Steps

1. Complete the comprehensive audit of all 83 documentation files against implementation
2. Update this matrix with findings from the complete audit
3. Prioritize incomplete features based on user impact and implementation complexity
4. Develop detailed implementation plans for high-priority features
