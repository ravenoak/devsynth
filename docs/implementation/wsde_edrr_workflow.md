# WSDE-EDRR Workflow

The finalized WSDE-EDRR workflow links the Worker Self-Directed Enterprise team model with the Expand–Differentiate–Refine–Retrospect methodology.

## Phase Progression

Each transition invokes `progress_roles`, reassigning roles for the new phase and flushing queued memory updates through the provided memory manager. The coordinator retains the mapping so external consumers can inspect current responsibilities.

## Memory Synchronization

Queued updates collected during a phase are flushed on boundary crossing. This prevents collaboration utilities from stalling and keeps cross-store data in sync.

## Role Accessibility

Role assignments for the active phase are accessible via `get_role_assignments`, enabling downstream processes to understand which agent holds a given responsibility.
