# DevSynth Phase 2 Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for Phase 2 of the DevSynth project, focusing on Production Readiness. The plan addresses the key areas identified in the roadmap and builds upon the foundation established in Phase 1.

## Goals

1. Improve user experience for both CLI and WebUI interfaces
2. Enhance stability and reliability of core components
3. Expand test coverage and improve test infrastructure
4. Standardize documentation and error handling
5. Implement advanced features for code generation and analysis

## Implementation Areas

### 1. CLI UX Improvements

#### Progress Indicators

- Implement a consistent progress indicator system for long-running operations
- Add support for different indicator types (spinner, bar, percentage)
- Ensure indicators work in both interactive and non-interactive modes

```python
# Example implementation
class ProgressIndicator:
    def __init__(self, total=None, desc=None, indicator_type="spinner"):
        self.total = total
        self.desc = desc
        self.indicator_type = indicator_type

    def start(self):
        # Initialize the progress indicator
        pass

    def update(self, n=1):
        # Update progress
        pass

    def finish(self):
        # Complete the progress indicator
        pass
```

#### Enhanced Error Messages

- Develop a standardized error message format with actionable suggestions
- Implement error categorization (user error, system error, network error, etc.)
- Add context-aware help links and documentation references

```python
# Example implementation
def format_error_message(error, context=None, suggestions=None):
    """Format an error message with context and suggestions."""
    message = f"ERROR: {str(error)}"

    if context:
        message += f"\nContext: {context}"

    if suggestions:
        message += "\nSuggestions:"
        for suggestion in suggestions:
            message += f"\n  - {suggestion}"

    return message
```

#### Shell Completion

- Implement shell completion scripts for bash, zsh, and fish
- Add dynamic completion for context-aware arguments
- Provide installation instructions for different environments

#### Command Output Standardization

- Define consistent output formats for different command types
- Implement support for multiple output formats (text, JSON, YAML)
- Ensure all commands follow the standardized output format

### 2. WebUI Integration

#### WizardState Integration

- Complete the integration of the WizardState class in all WebUI wizards
- Ensure consistent state persistence between wizard steps
- Implement proper error handling and validation in all wizards

```python
# Example usage in a wizard
def requirements_wizard():
    # Initialize the wizard state
    wizard_state = WizardState("requirements_wizard", steps=3)

    # Handle each step
    current_step = wizard_state.get_current_step()

    if current_step == 1:
        handle_step_1(wizard_state)
    elif current_step == 2:
        handle_step_2(wizard_state)
    elif current_step == 3:
        handle_step_3(wizard_state)

    # Navigation controls
    handle_navigation(wizard_state)
```

#### Test Infrastructure Updates

- Develop a robust mocking strategy for NiceGUI components
- Create reusable test fixtures for WebUI components
- Implement proper handling of experimental_rerun in tests

```python
# Example test fixture
@pytest.fixture
def mock_streamlit_wizard():
    """Create a mock NiceGUI environment for testing wizards."""
    with patch("streamlit.button") as mock_button, \
         patch("streamlit.text_input") as mock_text_input, \
         patch("streamlit.experimental_rerun") as mock_rerun:

        # Configure the mocks
        mock_button.return_value = False
        mock_text_input.return_value = ""

        yield {
            "button": mock_button,
            "text_input": mock_text_input,
            "rerun": mock_rerun
        }
```

#### UXBridge Consistency

- Resolve inconsistencies between CLI and WebUI implementations of UXBridge
- Implement a unified approach to handling user interactions
- Ensure consistent error handling and messaging across interfaces

#### Responsive Design

- Improve WebUI layout for different screen sizes
- Implement responsive components that adapt to available space
- Add mobile-friendly navigation and interaction patterns

### 3. Repository Analysis and Code Organization

#### Code Structure Analysis

- Implement tools for analyzing repository structure
- Develop visualization of code dependencies and relationships
- Add recommendations for code organization improvements

#### Refactoring Support

- Create tools for automated refactoring suggestions
- Implement safe code transformation utilities
- Add support for tracking and validating refactoring changes

### 4. Automated Testing and CI/CD Expansion

#### BDD Test Coverage

- Create comprehensive BDD tests for all CLI commands
- Implement scenario-based testing for common workflows
- Ensure test coverage for edge cases and error conditions

#### Test Metrics System

- Develop a system for tracking test coverage and failures
- Implement reporting tools for test metrics
- Integrate test metrics with CI/CD pipeline

#### CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements

- Expand CI/CD pipeline to include performance testing
- Add automated documentation generation
- Implement deployment verification tests

### 5. Multi-language Code Generation

#### Language Support Expansion

- Add support for additional programming languages
- Implement language-specific code generation templates
- Ensure consistent quality across different languages

#### Code Quality Assurance

- Implement static analysis for generated code
- Add support for code style enforcement
- Develop validation tools for generated code

### 6. AST Mutation Tooling

#### AST Analysis

- Implement tools for analyzing and visualizing ASTs
- Develop pattern matching for common code structures
- Add support for identifying optimization opportunities

#### Safe Mutation Operations

- Create a library of safe AST transformation operations
- Implement validation for AST mutations
- Add support for previewing and applying mutations
