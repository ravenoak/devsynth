# WSDE Model Validation

This document provides a comprehensive validation of the current implementation status of the WSDE (WSDE) model within DevSynth. It is a key deliverable of the WSDE Model Validation conducted as part of Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization.

## Model Overview

The WSDE model is a collaborative agent system with peer-based interactions that guides how agents work together in DevSynth. Key principles include:

**Implementation Status:** The WSDE model is partially implemented with an overall completeness of about 45%.

1. **Non-hierarchical Decision Making**: Decisions made through consensus rather than top-down authority
2. **Dynamic Role Assignment**: Roles assigned based on expertise and context rather than fixed positions
3. **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Multiple agents working together to solve complex problems
4. **Transparent Decision Justification**: Clear reasoning and evidence for all decisions


## Implementation Status by Component

### Non-Hierarchical Decision Making

| Component | Status | Completeness | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-------|

## Current Limitations

The WSDE model is only partially realized. Dynamic leadership, consensus
building, and collaborative memory are still incomplete. By default the
`features.wsde_collaboration` and `features.dialectical_reasoning` flags in
`config/default.yml` are disabled, so these capabilities must be manually
enabled. The
[Feature Status Matrix](feature_status_matrix.md) tracks ongoing progress.
