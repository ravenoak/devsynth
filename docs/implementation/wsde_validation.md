# WSDE Model Validation

This document provides a comprehensive validation of the current implementation status of the WSDE (Worker Self-Directed Enterprise) model within DevSynth. It is a key deliverable of the WSDE Model Validation conducted as part of Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization.

## Model Overview

The WSDE model is a collaborative agent system with peer-based interactions that guides how agents work together in DevSynth. Key principles include:

**Implementation Status:** The WSDE model is partially implemented with an overall completeness of 60%.

1. **Non-hierarchical Decision Making**: Decisions made through consensus rather than top-down authority
2. **Dynamic Role Assignment**: Roles assigned based on expertise and context rather than fixed positions
3. **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Multiple agents working together to solve complex problems
4. **Transparent Decision Justification**: Clear reasoning and evidence for all decisions

## Current Limitations

While the WSDE model is progressing, several components remain only partially implemented.
Dynamic role assignments and consensus algorithms require additional testing and tuning.
Collaborative memory features are functional but lack sophisticated indexing and synthesis. Consensus summaries and voting result utilities are now available.
Dialectical reasoning support is still experimental. Refer to the
[Feature Status Matrix](feature_status_matrix.md) for detailed progress tracking.
