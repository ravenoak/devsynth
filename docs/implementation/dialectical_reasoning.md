# Dialectical Reasoning Workflow

This document outlines the steps used by the `DialecticalReasonerService` to evaluate requirement changes.

1. **Thesis Generation** – produce a thesis supporting the change.
2. **Antithesis Generation** – identify counter-arguments.
3. **Argument Weighing** – compile supporting and opposing arguments.
4. **Synthesis** – reconcile the thesis and antithesis.
5. **Conclusion and Recommendation** – deliver a decision and follow-up actions.
6. **Impact Assessment** – determine affected requirements and components, risk level, effort, analysis, and recommendations.
7. **Memory Persistence** – store reasoning and impact assessments in the memory manager with associated EDRR phase. Failures are logged but do not interrupt the workflow.
8. **Notification** – notify interested parties when analysis completes.

This workflow enables traceable reasoning and retrospective analysis across EDRR phases.
