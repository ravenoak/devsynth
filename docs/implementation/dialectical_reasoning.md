# Dialectical Reasoning Workflow

This document outlines the steps used by the `DialecticalReasonerService` to evaluate requirement changes.

1. **Thesis Generation** – produce a thesis supporting the change.
2. **Antithesis Generation** – identify counter-arguments.
3. **Argument Weighing** – compile supporting and opposing arguments.
4. **Synthesis** – reconcile the thesis and antithesis.
5. **Conclusion and Recommendation** – deliver a decision and follow-up actions.
6. **Impact Assessment** – determine affected requirements and components, risk level, effort, analysis, and recommendations.
7. **Memory Persistence** – store reasoning and impact assessments in the memory manager with associated EDRR phase. Failures are logged but do not interrupt the workflow.
8. **Notification** – notify interested parties when analysis completes.

This workflow enables traceable reasoning and retrospective analysis across EDRR phases.

## Verification Evidence

Dialectical reasoning hooks expose the workflow's outcomes to observing services (for example, the WSDE team and memory integrations). Their behavior is now demonstrated by a trio of complementary proofs:

- **Behavior-driven coverage** – `tests/behavior/features/dialectical_reasoning.feature` exercises both consensus success and failure paths, while the associated step definitions in `tests/behavior/steps/test_dialectical_reasoning_hooks_steps.py` assert that registered hooks receive the correct change identifier and consensus flag under each outcome.
- **Unit coverage** – `tests/unit/application/requirements/test_dialectical_reasoner.py` validates that `DialecticalReasonerService.register_evaluation_hook` interoperates with `WSDETeam.requirement_evaluation_hook`, persisting results for both consensus and non-consensus evaluations.
- **Property-based coverage** – `tests/property/test_reasoning_loop_properties.py::test_reasoning_loop_invokes_dialectical_hooks` generates diverse synthesis sequences and proves that each dialectical iteration triggers registered hooks with the evolving task context and synthesis payload.

Together these assets ensure the reasoning-loop hooks remain observable, auditable, and regression-safe across deterministic, unit-level, and generative test boundaries.
