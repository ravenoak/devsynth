# DevSynth Project Status

> **Status:** Partial â€” deployment automation improvements tracked in [issue 109](../../issues/109.md).

This document tracks the current status of the DevSynth project, including implementation progress, test status, and upcoming tasks. It serves as a central reference for project status and is updated regularly as part of the development process.

## Current Date

August 2, 2025

## Implementation Status

The overall project is **partially implemented**. Approximately **70%** of documented features are functional. Work continues toward the `0.1.0-beta.1` milestone, but several integration tests remain unstable.

### Key Metrics

- **Feature Completion**: ~70% of planned features implemented
- **Test Status**: 348 failing tests out of 2,794 total tests (12.5% failure rate)
- **Documentation**: Documentation cleanup and organization in progress

For a detailed breakdown of feature status, see the [Feature Status Matrix](feature_status_matrix.md).

## Traceability Matrix

Each contributor tracks requirement coverage in a local `traceability.json`
(ignored by version control). Each entry maps a `TraceID` to related features,
affected files, tests, and the associated issue.

```json
{
  "TraceID": {
    "features": ["description of functionality"],
    "files": ["path/to/file.py"],
    "tests": ["pytest command or test paths"],
    "issue": "issue reference or null"
  }
}
```

The `scripts/update_traceability.py` helper runs in CI to append new entries based on MVUU metadata.


## Test Status

Recent CI runs report **348** failing tests and **921** passing tests with **100** skipped. Test collection triggered **3** errors. Unfinished WSDE collaboration features and cross-store memory integration remain the primary sources of failures, blocking `0.1.0-beta.1`.

### Test Categorization Progress

- Improved from 124 to 427 out of 2,794 tests (15.3%) with speed markers
- Tests categorized by speed:
  - Fast: 0 tests
  - Medium: 426 tests
  - Slow: 1 test
  - Unmarked: 2,367 tests

### Test Isolation and Determinism

The test isolation analyzer has identified several issues that need to be addressed:

- Global state usage in tests
- Shared resources between tests
- Improper fixture usage
- Missing teardown in test classes

These issues are being addressed as part of the Phase 1 Foundation Stabilization effort.

## Documentation Status

Documentation cleanup and organization is in progress. See [Documentation Update Progress](/docs/DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_PROGRESS.md) for details.

### Completed Documentation Tasks

- Consolidated roadmap documents into a single source of truth (`docs/roadmap/CONSOLIDATED_ROADMAP.md`)
- Archived original roadmap documents in `docs/archived/roadmaps/`
- Updated references to roadmap documents in README.md
- Fixed inaccurate dates in documentation files
- Updated core documentation with current project status

## Current Focus Areas

The following areas are currently the focus of development efforts:

1. **Test Stabilization**: Fixing failing tests and improving test isolation
2. **Memory System Integration**: Resolving cross-store memory synchronization issues
3. **WebUI State Management**: Fixing state persistence issues in WebUI wizards
4. **Documentation Cleanup**: Consolidating and improving documentation

## Immediate Tasks

1. **Test Stabilization**:
   - Resolving test failures (approximately 348 failing tests out of 2,794 total tests)
   - Improving test isolation and determinism
   - Continuing test categorization by speed

2. **Memory System Integration**:
   - Fixing cross-store memory synchronization issues
   - Implementing proper transaction handling for all memory stores
   - Adding comprehensive error handling and recovery

3. **WebUI State Management**:
   - Fixing state persistence issues in WebUI wizards
   - Implementing proper error handling and recovery
   - Adding comprehensive tests for WebUI state management

4. **Documentation Cleanup**:
   - Continuing documentation consolidation and organization
   - Updating documentation to reflect current project status
   - Ensuring consistent formatting and style across all documentation

## Next Steps

The following tasks are planned for the next phase of development:

1. **Medium Priority Tasks**:
   - Reorganize documentation structure
   - Improve developer onboarding
   - Enhance architecture documentation

2. **Lower Priority Tasks**:
   - Documentation process improvements
   - Content enhancement
   - Accessibility improvements

## Notes and Observations

- An existing documentation cleanup effort was documented in `docs/DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_PROGRESS.md`, which has been updated with the current date.
- The roadmap documents have been consolidated into `docs/roadmap/CONSOLIDATED_ROADMAP.md` and the original documents have been archived.
- Future dates in documentation files have been corrected to reflect the current date (August 2, 2025).
