# Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

This matrix links requirements to design, code modules, and tests, ensuring bidirectional traceability and coverage. Update this file as requirements, code, and tests evolve.

## Traceability JSON Format

Traceability metadata is stored in a local `traceability.json` (not committed to the repository) with each entry keyed by a `TraceID` such as `DSY-0001`. Entries capture:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `features` | Summary of the feature or change. |
| `files` | List of affected file paths. |
| `tests` | Commands or references validating the change. |
| `issue` | Related issue identifier in `DSY-<id>` format. |
| `mvuu` | Set to `true` when the commit follows MVUU guidelines. |
| `notes` | Optional context for reviewers. |

Example:

```json
{
  "DSY-0001": {
    "features": [
      "Documented MVUU schema for tracking minimal updates."
    ],
    "files": [
      "docs/specifications/mvuuschema.json",
      "docs/specifications/mvuu_example.json"
    ],
    "tests": [
      "poetry run pytest tests/"
    ],
    "issue": "DSY-0001",
    "mvuu": true,
    "notes": "Initial schema documentation."
  }
}
```

> **Note:** `traceability.json` is ignored by version control and should remain local to each contributor.

## MVU Configuration

Initialize MVU support by creating `.devsynth/mvu.yml`:

```bash
devsynth mvu init
```

This file stores the default schema path and storage settings for MVUU records.

## MVUU Database Integration

Traceability entries correspond to detailed MVUU records stored in
`docs/specifications/mvuu_database.json`. Each record follows the
[`docs/specifications/mvuuschema.json`](specifications/mvuuschema.json) format and includes a
`TraceID` that matches an entry in your local `traceability.json`. This linkage
enables the database to serve as a repository-wide log of MVUU metadata while the
traceability matrix summarizes how each change maps to requirements, files and
tests. When adding a new MVUU record, ensure the same `TraceID` appears in your
local `traceability.json` so requirements coverage reflects the update.

## Update Procedure

Run `scripts/update_traceability.py` after tests pass to append MVUU metadata
from the latest commit into your local `traceability.json`.

### Git Hook

Enable the `pre-push` hook to automate this step:

```bash
ln -s ../../scripts/hooks/pre-push-traceability.sh .git/hooks/pre-push
```

The hook runs the test suite and updates your local `traceability.json` when the
tests complete successfully.

### Reporting

Generate a matrix from MVUU metadata stored in commit history:

```bash
devsynth mvu report --since origin/main --format markdown --output trace.md
```

Use `--format html` to produce an HTML table. Omitting `--output` prints the
report to standard output.

## Implementation Status

Several requirements remain **partially implemented**. Consult the status column
above and the [Feature Status Matrix](implementation/feature_status_matrix.md)
for work still in progress. Outstanding areas include memory store
synchronization (FR-59, FR-60), the EDRR and WSDE collaboration features
(FR-40–FR-43), and support for alternative vector stores (FR-48). Current test
runs report **348** failing integration tests, primarily around memory
initialization and multi-agent workflows. See
[development_status](../roadmap/development_status.md#test-failure-summary) for
details.
