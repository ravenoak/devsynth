# Requirements Traceability Matrix

Owner: DevSynth Maintainers

## Summary
- Functional requirements FR-41 through FR-43 for WSDE collaboration, role management, and dialectical reasoning now map directly to the refreshed WSDE specifications and their executable behaviour suites, closing the backlog noted in the plan.【F:docs/system_requirements_specification.md†L171-L173】【F:docs/specifications/wsde-peer-review-workflow.md†L1-L80】【F:docs/specifications/wsde-message-passing-and-peer-review.md†L1-L75】【F:docs/specifications/consensus-building.md†L1-L81】
- Behaviour-driven coverage exercises message passing, consensus voting, and dialectical peer review flows across the WSDE feature files, ensuring end-to-end traces for each requirement.【F:tests/behavior/features/wsde_peer_review_workflow.feature†L1-L87】【F:tests/behavior/features/wsde_voting_mechanisms_for_critical_decisions.feature†L1-L31】【F:tests/behavior/features/consensus_building.feature†L1-L15】
- Unit suites persist peer-review records, serialize consensus payloads, and detect conflicting opinions so the specifications have deterministic regression coverage backing the requirements.【F:tests/unit/domain/test_wsde_peer_review_workflow.py†L1-L40】【F:tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_peer_review_store.py†L1-L199】【F:tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_conflict_detection.py†L1-L38】【F:tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_utils.py†L1-L19】
- Verification for this update is archived in the diagnostics captured during the current session, including the fast+medium CLI attempt and the traceability check output.【F:diagnostics/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20250929T191821Z.txt†L1-L27】【F:diagnostics/verify_requirements_traceability_20250929T191832Z.txt†L1-L1】

## WSDE collaboration requirements

| FR-43 — Implement dialectical reasoning in collaboration【F:docs/system_requirements_specification.md†L173-L173】 | WSDE peer review workflow specification emphasising dialectical analysis in review cycles【F:docs/specifications/wsde-peer-review-workflow.md†L37-L70】 | Peer review feature scenario covering thesis/antithesis/synthesis feedback within WSDE teams【F:tests/behavior/features/wsde_peer_review_workflow.feature†L71-L78】 | Peer review store tests capturing reviewer notes and consensus metadata for dialectical artefacts【F:tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_peer_review_store.py†L126-L199】 |

## Audit artefacts
- `diagnostics/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20250929T191821Z.txt` — captured the fast+medium CLI attempt showing the missing `devsynth` entry point so bootstrap remediation can be tracked alongside requirement verification.【F:diagnostics/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20250929T191821Z.txt†L1-L27】
- `diagnostics/verify_requirements_traceability_20250929T191832Z.txt` — proof that the requirements traceability script recognised the refreshed WSDE specifications in this update.【F:diagnostics/verify_requirements_traceability_20250929T191832Z.txt†L1-L1】
