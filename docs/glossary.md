# DevSynth Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for domain-specific terminology used throughout the DevSynth project documentation. It serves as a reference for both users and developers to ensure consistent understanding of key concepts.

## Terminology Management Approach

This glossary follows terminology management best practices:

1. **Concept-based Approach**: Each term is defined based on its underlying concept rather than just usage examples
2. **Clarity and Precision**: Definitions are clear, concise, and avoid ambiguity
3. **Subject Field Orientation**: Terms are organized by domain (EDRR methodology, WSDE collaboration, memory systems, etc.)
4. **Systematic Management**: All bespoke DevSynth terms are documented here with consistent formatting
5. **Quality Assurance**: Definitions are reviewed for accuracy and completeness
6. **Harmonization**: Terminology is standardized across all documentation to avoid confusion

For questions about specific terms or suggestions for new entries, please refer to the contribution guidelines or open an issue in the project repository.

## A

### Adaptive Project Ingestion
The process by which DevSynth dynamically understands and adapts to diverse project structures (including monorepos, multi-language projects, and custom layouts) using a `.devsynth/project.yaml` file and the EDRR methodology.

### Agent
An autonomous software component that performs specific tasks within the DevSynth system, such as code generation, analysis, or requirement refinement.

### Agent System
The collection of modular agents and their orchestration framework within DevSynth, powered by LangGraph. The system implements the WSDE (Worker Self-Directed Enterprise) model for multi-agent collaboration and uses dialectical reasoning for decision-making.

### Atomic MVUU Commits
A development practice in DevSynth where each commit represents a single Minimum Viable Utility Unit (MVUU), ensuring that every change provides measurable value and maintains project integrity.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of protocols and tools for building software applications, defining how software components should interact.

### AgentAdapter
A component that provides a direct interface for interacting with DevSynth's agent capabilities from Python code.

## B

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
A software development methodology that focuses on defining the behavior of a system from the user's perspective using Gherkin syntax (Given/When/Then).

### Breadcrumb Navigation
A navigation aid that shows the hierarchical path to the current document, helping users understand their location within the documentation structure.

## C

### ChromaDB
A vector database used by DevSynth for semantic search and scalable artifact storage.

### CLI (Command Line Interface)
The primary interface for interacting with DevSynth through terminal commands.

### Code Analysis
The process of examining code to understand its structure, dependencies, complexity, and potential issues, implemented in DevSynth using NetworkX.

### CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
A software development practice that involves automatically building, testing, and deploying code changes.

## D

### Dialectical Reasoning
A structured approach to problem-solving that involves thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. In DevSynth, agents engage in dialectical reasoning by presenting initial solutions (thesis), generating critiques and counterarguments (antithesis), and synthesizing improved solutions (synthesis). This process is fundamental to multi-agent collaboration and EDRR phases.

### Documentation Harmony
The principle that all code, tests, and documents should be kept in sync, with traceability via the Requirements Traceability Matrix.

## E

### EDRR (Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect)
A comprehensive methodology and framework used throughout DevSynth for iterative problem-solving and development, consisting of four recursive phases:
- **Expand**: Generate diverse approaches and explore multiple perspectives
- **Differentiate**: Analyze and evaluate options against requirements and criteria
- **Refine**: Improve and optimize selected solutions through iteration
- **Retrospect**: Review outcomes and capture learnings for future improvement

The EDRR framework operates as a recursive, fractal structure where each macro phase contains nested micro-EDRR cycles, enabling self-optimization at multiple levels of granularity. It integrates with all major DevSynth components including WSDE multi-agent collaboration and hybrid memory systems.

### EDRRCoordinator
The component that orchestrates the EDRR process across all system components.

## H

### Hexagonal Architecture
An architectural pattern used in DevSynth that separates core logic from external concerns through ports and adapters, enhancing testability and extensibility. Also known as Ports and Adapters pattern.

### Hybrid Memory Architecture
DevSynth's multi-layered memory system that combines multiple storage backends for different types of information:
- **Vector Store (ChromaDB)**: Semantic search and similarity-based retrieval
- **Graph Store (Kuzu)**: Relational data and dependency tracking
- **Structured Store (TinyDB/SQLite)**: Metadata and project configuration
- **RDF Store (RDFLib)**: Knowledge representation and semantic relationships

This hybrid approach enables efficient storage and retrieval of diverse information types throughout the software development lifecycle.

## J

### JSONFileStore
A simple file-based storage adapter used in DevSynth for legacy and lightweight use cases.

## K

### Kuzu
A graph database used as one of the optional vector store backends in DevSynth.

## L

### LangGraph
A framework for orchestrating workflows with LLMs, used in DevSynth to coordinate agent activities.

### LLM (Large Language Model)
A type of AI model that can understand and generate human language, used in DevSynth for code generation, analysis, and other tasks.

### LM Studio
A tool for running local LLM models, supported as a provider in DevSynth.

## M

### MemoryPort
A unified interface in DevSynth for memory operations, supporting multiple backends such as ChromaDB, TinyDB, and JSON.

### MVUU (Minimum Viable Utility Units)
The smallest useful unit of work that provides measurable value to the project, recorded by DevSynth for traceability and progress reporting. MVUUs represent atomic changes that:
- Are independently valuable and testable
- Have clear acceptance criteria
- Include all necessary documentation and tests
- Can be tracked through the development lifecycle
- Support requirements traceability

Each MVUU is documented with a utility statement, affected files, tests, traceability ID (DSY-XXXX format), and related issue references. The MVUU engine enables granular progress tracking and quality assurance.

## N

### NetworkX
A Python library used in DevSynth for dependency graphing, complexity metrics, and refactoring suggestions.

## O

### Offline Mode
A DevSynth operating mode that functions without network access, using either deterministic text generation or local models.

### OfflineProvider
The LLM provider used when DevSynth is in offline mode, generating deterministic text and embeddings or loading a local model.

## P

### Provider System
The abstraction layer in DevSynth that manages interactions with different LLM providers (OpenAI, LM Studio, etc.) with fallback and selection logic.

### Property-Based Testing
A testing approach that verifies properties of functions across a range of inputs, implemented in DevSynth using the Hypothesis library.

## R

### Requirements Traceability Matrix
A comprehensive tracking system in DevSynth that maps requirements to design decisions, code implementations, tests, and validation evidence. The matrix ensures bidirectional traceability, enabling teams to understand how requirements are implemented and how code changes impact requirements. It supports automated validation and maintains links between all SDLC artifacts.

## S

### SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
The process of planning, creating, testing, and deploying software, which DevSynth aims to automate and enhance.

### Semantic Versioning+
DevSynth's versioning policy, based on Semantic Versioning with additional rules specific to the project.

## T

### TinyDBMemoryAdapter
A structured data storage adapter in DevSynth for project metadata, relationships, and the project structure model.

## U

### UXBridge
A shared interface abstraction in DevSynth that provides unified interaction methods (`ask_question`, `confirm_choice`, `display_result`) across different user interfaces (CLI, WebUI, and Agent API). This architectural pattern enables consistent user experience and simplifies the addition of new interface types.

## V

### Vector Store
A database optimized for storing and retrieving vector embeddings, used in DevSynth for semantic search capabilities.

## W

### WebUI
A graphical user interface for DevSynth based on NiceGUI, providing an alternative to the CLI.

### WSDE (Worker Self-Directed Enterprise) Model
A sophisticated multi-agent collaboration framework in DevSynth with role management, dialectical reasoning, consensus building, and knowledge integration capabilities.
