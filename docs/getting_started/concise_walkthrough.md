# Concise DevSynth Walkthrough

This walkthrough provides a short overview of the DevSynth workflow.
For additional details, see the [Quick Start Guide](quick_start_guide.md).

## Environment Requirements

DevSynth requires **Python 3.12 or higher**. Poetry is recommended for managing dependencies.

If you prefer a GUI, you can run `devsynth webui` and follow the same steps using the WebUI pages.

## 1. Initialize a Project

Create a new project directory named `demo`:

```bash

# Create and enter the project directory

devsynth init --path demo
cd demo
```

`devsynth init` now walks you through an interactive setup if it detects existing project files.

The command generates a `.devsynth/project.yaml` file and bootstraps a basic
project layout:

```
demo/
├── .devsynth/
│   └── project.yaml
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/sample_test.py
│   ├── integration/sample_integration_test.py
│   └── behavior/
│       ├── features/sample.feature
│       └── steps/sample_steps.py
```

For reference, you can look at the example configuration in
[`templates/project.yaml`](../../templates/project.yaml).

## 2. Add Requirements

Create a `requirements.md` file with a few simple requirements. Example:

```markdown

# Project Requirements

- The system shall add two numbers.
- The system shall subtract two numbers.

```

## 3. Generate Specs, Tests, and Code

Run the DevSynth commands in sequence:

```bash

# Generate specifications

devsynth inspect

# Generate tests

devsynth run-pipeline

# Generate implementation code

devsynth refactor
```

## 4. Run the Tests

Execute the generated tests with either `pytest` or the DevSynth runner:

```bash

# Using pytest

pytest

# Or using DevSynth

devsynth run-pipeline
```

If the tests pass, your generated code is working. If you encounter issues, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md).
