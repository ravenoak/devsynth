# WebUI Onboarding Flow

The WebUI provides a simple series of pages for initializing and managing a project.
Use the sidebar navigation to choose **Onboarding**, then fill out the form to create
or load a DevSynth project.

With version 1.0 the WebUI also includes **EDRR** and **Alignment** pages
for advanced workflows. These options appear in the sidebar after launching
`devsynth webui`.
