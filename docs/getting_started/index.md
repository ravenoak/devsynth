# Getting Started with DevSynth

This section provides essential information for getting started with DevSynth, including installation instructions and basic usage guides.

- **[Concise Walkthrough](concise_walkthrough.md)**: A short summary of the basic workflow.
- **[Quick Start Guide](quick_start_guide.md)**: A step-by-step tutorial to help you get started with DevSynth quickly.
- **[Installation](installation.md)**: Detailed instructions for installing DevSynth and its dependencies.
- **[Basic Usage](basic_usage.md)**: An introduction to the basic usage of DevSynth.
- **[Example Project](example_project.md)**: A complete walk-through using the calculator example.

## Environment Requirements

DevSynth requires **Python 3.12 or higher**. For development workflows, the team recommends managing dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

## Overview

DevSynth is a powerful tool that helps developers generate code from requirements using AI. This section will help you install DevSynth, understand its basic usage, and get started with your first project.

If you're new to DevSynth, we recommend starting with the [Quick Start Guide](quick_start_guide.md), which will walk you through the process of creating your first DevSynth project.
