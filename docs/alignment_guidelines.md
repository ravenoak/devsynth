# Alignment Guidelines for DevSynth SDLC Artifacts

## Introduction

This document provides guidelines for maintaining alignment between Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) artifacts in the DevSynth project. Alignment ensures that requirements, specifications, tests, and code remain synchronized throughout the development lifecycle, reducing inconsistencies and improving overall product quality.

## Core Principles

### 1. Bidirectional Traceability

All artifacts should maintain bidirectional traceability:
- Requirements should trace forward to specifications, tests, and code
- Code, tests, and specifications should trace backward to requirements
- Changes to any artifact should trigger a review of related artifacts

### 2. Consistent Terminology

Consistent terminology should be used across all artifacts:
- Use the glossary of terms defined in the project documentation
- Avoid introducing new terms without updating the glossary
- Maintain consistent capitalization and naming conventions

### 3. Synchronized Updates

When updating an artifact, related artifacts should be updated in sync:
- When a requirement changes, update related specifications, tests, and code
- When implementing code, ensure it aligns with specifications and tests
- When writing tests, verify they match specifications and requirements

### 4. Minimal Redundancy

Avoid unnecessary duplication of information across artifacts:
- Reference existing artifacts rather than duplicating content
- When duplication is necessary, ensure consistent mechanisms for keeping copies in sync
- Use templates and standardized formats to ensure consistency

## Artifact-Specific Guidelines

### Requirements

1. **Identification**: Each requirement should have a unique identifier (e.g., FR-01, NFR-02)
2. **Specification Links**: Requirements should explicitly reference related specifications
3. **Verification Method**: Requirements should specify how they will be verified (test, inspection, demonstration)
4. **Status Tracking**: Requirements should include status information (proposed, approved, implemented, verified)

### Specifications

1. **Requirement References**: Specifications should reference the requirements they fulfill
2. **Test Coverage**: Specifications should indicate expected test coverage
3. **Implementation Notes**: Specifications should include notes for implementers
4. **Design Decisions**: Specifications should document design decisions and alternatives considered

### Tests

1. **Specification References**: Tests should reference the specifications they verify
2. **Requirement Coverage**: Tests should indicate which requirements they verify
3. **Test Data**: Tests should include or reference necessary test data
4. **Edge Cases**: Tests should cover normal paths, edge cases, and error conditions

### Code

1. **Test References**: Code should reference related tests
2. **Specification Conformance**: Code should conform to specifications
3. **Requirement Fulfillment**: Code should fulfill requirements
4. **Documentation**: Code should include documentation that references specifications and requirements

## Alignment Verification Process

### Pre-Implementation

Before implementing a feature:
1. Review related requirements and specifications
2. Verify that requirements have corresponding specifications
3. Verify that specifications have corresponding test plans
4. Identify any inconsistencies or gaps

### During Implementation

While implementing a feature:
1. Regularly check alignment with specifications
2. Update tests as implementation details are refined
3. Document any deviations from specifications
4. Keep a record of design decisions

### Post-Implementation

After implementing a feature:
1. Verify that all requirements are fulfilled
2. Verify that implementation matches specifications
3. Verify that tests cover all aspects of the implementation
4. Update documentation to reflect the final implementation

## Handling Misalignments

When misalignments are detected:

1. **Document the Issue**: Record the misalignment in the issue tracking system
2. **Assess Impact**: Determine the impact of the misalignment on the project
3. **Prioritize Resolution**: Assign a priority based on impact
4. **Resolve Systematically**: Address the root cause, not just the symptoms
5. **Verify Resolution**: Verify that the misalignment has been resolved
6. **Update Processes**: Update processes to prevent similar misalignments

## Tools and Techniques

### Traceability Matrix

Maintain a traceability matrix that links:
- Requirements to specifications
- Specifications to tests
- Tests to code
- Code to requirements

### Automated Checks

Use automated tools to check alignment:
- Requirements-to-specification consistency checks
- Specification-to-test consistency checks
- Test-to-code consistency checks
- Cross-cutting consistency checks

### Review Checklists

Use checklists during reviews to verify alignment:
- Requirements review checklist
- Specification review checklist
- Test review checklist
- Code review checklist

## Conclusion

Following these guidelines will help maintain alignment between SDLC artifacts in the DevSynth project. Consistent alignment reduces errors, improves maintainability, and ensures that the final product meets its requirements.
