# Gap Matrix

This matrix tracks the state of major DevSynth features. Update entries as features mature.

| Feature / Module | Planned | Implemented | Tested | Notes |
|------------------|---------|-------------|--------|-------|
| EDRR Framework (`src/devsynth/application/edrr/`) | Y | Partial | Partial | Unit tests in `tests/unit/application/edrr/` and integration coverage in `tests/integration/general/test_wsde_edrr_integration_end_to_end.py` |
| WSDE Agent Collaboration (`src/devsynth/application/collaboration/`) | Y | Partial | Partial | Voting logic exercised in `tests/unit/domain/test_wsde_voting_logic.py` |
| Memory System (`src/devsynth/application/memory/`) | Y | Y | Y | Managed via `MemoryManager`; validated by `tests/unit/application/memory/test_memory_manager.py` |
| CLI Interface (`src/devsynth/cli.py`, `src/devsynth/application/cli/`) | Y | Partial | Partial | Command loading tested in `tests/unit/cli/test_command_module_loading.py` |
| Deployment Automation (`docker-compose.yml`, `scripts/deployment/`) | Y | Partial | Partial | Deployment scripts checked by `tests/integration/deployment/test_deployment_scripts.py` |
