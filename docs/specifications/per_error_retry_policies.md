# Per-Error Retry Policies

## Problem

Global retry settings cannot accommodate exceptions that require custom retry
limits or disabling retries altogether.

## Proof

Implement a mapping of exception types to per-error policies consumed by
``retry_with_exponential_backoff``. Policies may specify ``max_retries`` and a
``retry`` flag that overrides the global behaviour. Policies match against
subclasses of the configured exception types so that a ``ValueError`` entry also
governs ``FileNotFoundError``.

When metrics are enabled, use ``prometheus_client`` counters to record when
named policies permit or suppress retries for observability.

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- Pending BDD scenarios will verify termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.
