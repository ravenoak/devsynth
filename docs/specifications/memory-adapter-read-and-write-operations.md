# Summary
# Dict-based cache layers and the multi-layered memory expose symmetric
read and write operations for key-value items, and the behavior suite now exercises
write-through propagation alongside missing-key error handling.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem? The memory system lacks a standard read/write API,
  making tests rely on internal method names.
- What proofs confirm the solution? Unit tests verify that values written via
  ``write`` are retrievable through ``read`` and that missing keys raise
  ``KeyError``.

## Motivation
Legacy adapters invoked private `set`/`get` methods directly, leaving test
code to mirror implementation details. A conventional `write`/`read` API
reduces duplication, makes layered cache expectations explicit, and keeps
behavior specifications stable as storage strategies evolve.

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/memory_adapter_read_and_write_operations.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/memory_adapter_read_and_write_operations.feature) assert write-through semantics and confirm `KeyError` is surfaced for unknown keys.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.

Providing a conventional read/write interface clarifies how memory components
are used and allows tests and adapters to interact with caches consistently.

## Specification
- ``DictCacheLayer`` adds ``write(key, value)`` and ``read(key)`` methods that
  delegate to ``set`` and ``get`` respectively.
- ``MultiLayeredMemory`` exposes ``write`` and ``read`` as aliases for ``set``
  and ``get``. Writes remain write-through across all layers, and reads promote
  values to higher layers.
- ``read`` raises ``KeyError`` when the key is absent from every layer.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Writing a value via ``write`` makes it available through ``read`` on both
  the cache layer and the multi-layered memory.
- ``write`` propagates values to all layers.
- ``read`` of an unknown key raises ``KeyError``.
