# CLI UI Improvements

## Summary

Streamlines interactive workflows in the command line by aligning them with the web UI and adds quality-of-life upgrades for long-running operations and command discovery.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/cli_ui_improvements.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/cli_ui_improvements.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.


The current CLI wizard contains redundant steps and provides little feedback during lengthy tasks. Users must also remember exact commands and flags.

## Specification

### Wizard Streamlining
- Reduce the number of prompts by mirroring the web UI wizard flow.
- Ensure step order and wording match between interfaces.

### Progress Indicators
- Display progress bars for operations that take noticeable time.
- Update indicators consistently with the web UI and mark completion clearly.

### Shell Completion
- Offer command and option completion for supported shells.
- Suggestions should stay in sync with web UI actions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- CLI wizard steps match the count and order of the web UI wizard.
- Long-running commands show progress start, updates, and completion.
- Tab completion returns the same command options presented in the web UI.
