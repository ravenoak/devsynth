# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation
The project lacks a clear specification for how dialectical reasoning should incorporate perspectives from multiple disciplines.

## Specification
- A dialectical reasoning session MAY involve agents with distinct disciplinary expertise.
- Each agent MUST contribute a perspective labeled with its discipline.
- The reasoning system MUST track disciplinary context for each perspective and synthesis step.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Drafted BDD scenario exercises multi-disciplinary reasoning without implementation.
