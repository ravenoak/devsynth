</div>

# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/multi_disciplinary_dialectical_reasoning.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/multi_disciplinary_dialectical_reasoning.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.

The project lacks a clear specification for how dialectical reasoning should incorporate perspectives from multiple disciplines.

## Specification
- A dialectical reasoning session MAY involve agents with distinct disciplinary expertise.
- Each agent MUST contribute a perspective labeled with its discipline.
- The reasoning system MUST track disciplinary context for each perspective and synthesis step.
- The WSDETeam interface SHALL expose a multi-disciplinary dialectical reasoning function.
- Decision loops like `run_basic_workflow` SHOULD invoke this function when available.

## Acceptance Criteria
- BDD scenarios cover gathering disciplinary perspectives and workflow integration.
