title: Logging Setup Utilities
version: 0.1.0-alpha.1
---

# Summary

Specifies low-level logging utilities that provide JSON formatting and request-context support.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation
Components require structured logs with optional request identifiers without configuring logging at import time.

## Specification
- Offer a `JSONFormatter` for structured logs.
- Provide `set_request_context` and `clear_request_context` helpers.
- Delay log directory creation until explicitly configured.

## Acceptance Criteria
- JSON logs include request identifiers when context is set.
- Importing the module does not create log directories.
