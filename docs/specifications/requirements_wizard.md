# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/requirements_wizard.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/requirements_wizard.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.

The interactive requirements wizard should provide an auditable record of each user interaction and persist the selected priority so subsequent tools can reference it.

## Specification
- The wizard records each step with `DevSynthLogger`, including the step name and chosen value.
- `DevSynthLogger` accepts exception objects via `exc_info` and renders full stack traces without crashing.
- The final priority selection is written to `.devsynth/project.yaml` via the configuration loader.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Running the wizard produces log entries for each step.
- The saved configuration contains the selected priority value.
- Supplying `exc_info` to `DevSynthLogger` does not raise errors.
