# Summary

DevSynth captures repeatable performance benchmarks for core operations.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
  - The system lacks baseline and scalability metrics.
- What proofs confirm the solution?
  - Metrics files recording workload, duration, and throughput.

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/performance_and_scalability_testing.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/performance_and_scalability_testing.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.

Understanding baseline performance and scalability enables regression detection and capacity planning.

## Specification
- Provide a baseline performance task that records duration and throughput for a given workload.
- Provide a scalability performance task that records metrics for multiple workloads.
- Metrics are written to `docs/performance/baseline_metrics.json` and `docs/performance/scalability_metrics.json`.
- Each metric entry includes `workload`, `duration_seconds`, and `throughput_ops_per_s`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Running the baseline task with workload `100000` creates `docs/performance/baseline_metrics.json` with throughput data.
- Running the scalability task for workloads `10000`, `100000`, and `1000000` writes corresponding entries.
- BDD tests cover baseline metrics, throughput calculation, and scalability results.
