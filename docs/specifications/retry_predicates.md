## Problem

Transient HTTP failures are currently detected only through exceptions. Responses with error status codes are returned to callers without automatic retry, reducing resilience.

## Proof

- A unit test mocks an HTTP response returning status code 503 followed by 200 and verifies the retry predicate triggers a retry and increments Prometheus metrics.
- A behavior-driven test demonstrates that functions using retry predicates eventually succeed after transient server errors.
