# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/consensus_building.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/consensus_building.feature) and [`tests/behavior/features/general/consensus_building.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/consensus_building.feature) run through [`tests/behavior/steps/test_basic_consensus_steps.py`](../../tests/behavior/steps/test_basic_consensus_steps.py) and [`tests/behavior/steps/test_consensus_building_steps.py`](../../tests/behavior/steps/test_consensus_building_steps.py), covering majority vote, threshold handling, conflict resolution, and decision tracking.
- Delegation and fallback scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/general/delegate_task_consensus.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/delegate_task_consensus.feature) and [`tests/behavior/features/general/wsde_voting_mechanisms.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/wsde_voting_mechanisms.feature) ensure consensus is integrated into voting flows when ties or failures occur.
- Unit suites such as [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_utils.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_utils.py), [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_summary.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_summary.py), and [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_conflict_detection.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_conflict_detection.py) verify weighted voting, logging, and conflict detection utilities.
- Property-based coverage in [`tests/property/test_reasoning_loop_properties.py`](../../tests/property/test_reasoning_loop_properties.py) ensures consensus hooks interact safely with the dialectical reasoning loop.


## Specification

- `build_consensus` aggregates votes and reasoning metadata, supporting configurable thresholds, weighted expertise, and tie-breaking strategies.
- WSDE teams fallback to consensus when voting deadlocks and document the fallback path, including contributing agents and rationales.
- Consensus summaries record contributors, method, reasoning, and comparative analyses for auditability and downstream persistence.
- Decision histories store vote tallies, explanations, and consensus metadata for later review.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Majority, weighted, and tie-breaking paths are all exercised by behavior suites and produce structured consensus objects.
- Consensus fallbacks surface when dialectical reasoning or voting fails, ensuring decisions remain traceable.
- Decision histories expose contributors, rationale, and method for each consensus result.
