title: Consensus Building
version: 0.1.0a1
---

# Summary

Consensus building ensures WSDE teams surface expertise-weighted perspectives,
resolve conflicts, and document final decisions with rationale. The general
feature at
[`tests/behavior/features/general/consensus_building.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/consensus_building.feature)
captures the baseline scenarios for weighted voting, conflict resolution,
tie-breaking, and decision tracking. Delegation hand-offs and voting safeguards
extend that behaviour in
[`tests/behavior/features/general/delegate_task_consensus.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/delegate_task_consensus.feature)
and
[`tests/behavior/features/general/wsde_voting_mechanisms.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/wsde_voting_mechanisms.feature),
which the workflow-specific suites mirror for regression coverage.

## Motivation

Transparent decision paths are a WSDE requirement. Aligning this specification
with the shared feature files keeps the documentation synchronized with domain
implementations in
[`src/devsynth/domain/models/wsde_voting.py`](../../src/devsynth/domain/models/wsde_voting.py)
and
[`src/devsynth/domain/models/wsde_decision_making.py`](../../src/devsynth/domain/models/wsde_decision_making.py),
as well as the coordination logic in
[`src/devsynth/application/collaboration/wsde_team_consensus.py`](../../src/devsynth/application/collaboration/wsde_team_consensus.py)
and
[`src/devsynth/consensus.py`](../../src/devsynth/consensus.py).
Referencing the general scenarios ensures weighted tallies, conflict mediation,
and tie-breaking strategies stay aligned with the unit suites that guard them.

## Specification

- **Voting mechanisms for critical decisions**: Teams collect votes from all
  agents, weight them by expertise, and select the option with the highest
  weighted score. Vote rationales accompany each ballot.
- **Conflict resolution in decision making**: When opinions diverge, the team
  documents dissent, facilitates structured dialogue, records reasoning, and
  captures the agreed resolution path.
- **Weighted voting based on expertise**: Expertise assessments remain visible
  and justifiable so the resulting decision references the contributing experts
  and the rationale for their influence.
- **Tie-breaking strategies**: Predefined adjudication rules execute when
  weighted scores tie, logging the method applied and the justification.
- **Decision tracking and explanation**: All decisions store metadata, weighted
  results, conflict notes, and stakeholder-ready narratives that are queryable
  for future review.
- **Delegated consensus hand-offs**: Consensus outputs feed task delegation by
  capturing contributor sets, failure fallbacks, and dialectical error handling
  as described in the delegation scenarios.
- **Voting safeguards**: Critical-decision workflows fall back to consensus and
  log tie-breaking steps per the voting mechanisms feature.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Mirrored features reuse the role statements and scenario names from the
  general features, demonstrating behaviour parity for each item above.
- Consensus services serialize decision outcomes, participant metadata, conflict
  indicators, and applied tie-breaking strategies as validated by
  [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_utils.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_utils.py),
  [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_conflict_detection.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_conflict_detection.py),
  and
  [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_memory_sync_hooks.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_memory_sync_hooks.py).
- Delegation workflows expose consensus payloads and error handling consistent
  with
  [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_delegate_workflows.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_delegate_workflows.py)
  and the integration expectations in
  [`tests/integration/general/test_run_pipeline_command.py`](../../tests/integration/general/test_run_pipeline_command.py).
