title: Multi-Layered Memory System and Tiered Cache Strategy
version: 0.1.0a1
---

# Summary
A tiered cache improves retrieval speed by placing frequently accessed data in
faster layers while delegating less common items to slower, larger stores.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem? The memory system lacks a hierarchy of caches, leading to
  uniform latency and no insight into hit efficiency.
- What proofs confirm the solution? Unit tests demonstrate value promotion across
  layers and correct hit‑ratio calculations.

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/multi_layered_memory_system_and_tiered_cache_strategy.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/multi_layered_memory_system_and_tiered_cache_strategy.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.

Efficient agents require fast memory lookups. A multi‑layered design balances
speed and capacity and exposes metrics for tuning cache sizes.

## Specification
- `MultiLayeredMemory` accepts an ordered list of cache layers implementing
  `get`, `set`, and `contains`.
- Reads search each layer in order; on a hit, the value is promoted to higher
  layers.
- Writes use a write‑through strategy, storing values in all layers.
- Statistics track total accesses and per‑layer hits.
- Overall hit ratio \(H\) for *n* layers is
  \(H = \sum_{i=1}^{n} h_i \prod_{j=1}^{i-1}(1-h_j)\) where \(h_i\) is the
  hit rate of layer *i*.
- Example two‑layer ratio: \(H = h_1 + (1-h_1)h_2\).
- A simple Monte Carlo simulation illustrates cache behaviour:

```python
import random
h1, h2 = 0.6, 0.3
trials = 10_000
hits = 0
for _ in range(trials):
    r1, r2 = random.random(), random.random()
    if r1 < h1 or (r1 >= h1 and r2 < h2):
        hits += 1
hit_ratio = hits / trials
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- Retrieving a value from a lower layer stores it in higher layers.
- `hit_ratio()` reports overall cache efficiency and per‑layer values.
- Accessing a missing key raises a `KeyError`.
