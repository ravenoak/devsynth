# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
  Fragmented storage and ad hoc caching make it difficult to keep frequently
  accessed items fast while preserving long‑term knowledge.
- What proofs confirm the solution?
  Unit tests and BDD scenarios record hit and miss statistics and verify LRU
  eviction across cache layers.

## Motivation
Efficient retrieval depends on a structured memory hierarchy. Organising items
into short‑term, episodic and semantic layers backed by a tiered cache keeps
hot data available without sacrificing persistence.

## Specification
- Memory is partitioned by `MemoryType` into short‑term, episodic and semantic
  stores.
- A tiered cache fronts these stores. Layers `L1..Ln` use an LRU policy and are
  checked in order until a value is found.
- Retrieving an item promotes it to all higher cache layers.
- `get_cache_stats` reports hit and miss counters for each layer.
- Cache capacity is configurable; a size of zero disables the layer.
- Caches may be cleared at runtime without affecting persistent stores.

## Cache Hit Ratio Modeling
For a cache hierarchy with per‑layer hit ratios `h_i`, the total hit ratio is

\[H = h_1 + (1 - h_1)h_2 + (1 - h_1)(1 - h_2)h_3 + \dots + \prod_{j=1}^{n-1}(1 - h_j)h_n\]

A simple approximation for each layer is `h_i ≈ 1 - e^{-λ_i C_i}`, where `λ_i`
is the request rate for items mapped to layer `i` and `C_i` its capacity. The
following Python snippet can simulate hit ratios given a request distribution:

```python
from random import choices

def simulate_hit_ratio(cache, items, probs, trials=1000):
    hits = 0
    for key in choices(items, probs, k=trials):
        if cache.get(key) is not None:
            hits += 1
        else:
            cache.set(key, key)
    return hits / trials
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- Storing items with types `CONTEXT`, `TASK_HISTORY` and `KNOWLEDGE` persists
  them to short‑term, episodic and semantic layers respectively.
- When caching is enabled, a second retrieval of an item increments cache hit
  counters.
- Cache size never exceeds the configured maximum.
