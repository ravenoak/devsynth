# Context Window Management Specification

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem? DevSynth doesn't track or optimize for different LLM provider context window limits, leading to inefficient resource usage
- What proofs confirm the solution? Provider context windows vary dramatically across models and change over time, requiring dynamic discovery and intelligent routing
- How can DevSynth optimize context usage? Implement provider-aware routing, dynamic budgeting, and automatic limit discovery

## Motivation

DevSynth currently treats all LLM providers as having equivalent context capabilities, but provider context windows vary significantly across different models and can change over time. Without dynamic discovery, the system cannot adapt to new models or updated limits.

This variance creates optimization opportunities and risks. Without context window awareness, DevSynth may:
- Underutilize high-context providers (wasting expensive resources)
- Exceed low-context provider limits (causing failures)
- Fail to route complex queries to appropriate providers
- Inefficiently allocate costs across different use cases

## Specification

### Core Context Window Principles

#### Provider-Aware Resource Management
- **Dynamic Budgeting**: Calculate available context budget after accounting for system prompts, conversation history, and tool definitions
- **Intelligent Routing**: Route queries to optimal providers based on complexity, required tools, and context needs
- **Cost Optimization**: Balance context utilization with provider costs and performance
- **Fallback Strategies**: Gracefully handle context limit approaches with tool reduction and query decomposition

#### Context Window Discovery and Tracking
- **Automatic Detection**: Discover provider limits through API introspection and model metadata
- **Dynamic Updates**: Track context window changes as providers update their models
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache provider information to reduce API calls while staying current
- **Validation Mechanisms**: Verify discovered limits through testing and monitoring

### Context Window Management Architecture

#### Dynamic Provider Registry System
DevSynth maintains a centralized registry that dynamically discovers and tracks provider capabilities:

```python
class ProviderRegistry:
    """Dynamic registry for LLM provider capabilities with automatic discovery."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.providers = {}  # Dynamically populated, never hardcoded
        self.discovery_cache = {}  # Cache for API discovery results
        self.last_discovery = {}  # Track when providers were last checked

    def discover_provider_capabilities(self, provider_id: str) -> dict:
        """Dynamically discover provider capabilities through API introspection."""
        # Check cache first (with reasonable TTL)
        if self._is_cache_valid(provider_id):
            return self.discovery_cache[provider_id]

        # Perform API discovery
        capabilities = self._discover_via_api(provider_id)

        # Validate discovered limits through testing
        validated_capabilities = self._validate_capabilities(capabilities)

        # Cache and return
        self._cache_capabilities(provider_id, validated_capabilities)
        return validated_capabilities

    def get_context_window(self, provider_id: str) -> int:
        """Get current context window limit for a provider."""
        capabilities = self.discover_provider_capabilities(provider_id)
        return capabilities.get('context_window', 4096)  # Safe fallback

    def _discover_via_api(self, provider_id: str) -> dict:
        """Discover capabilities through provider API introspection."""
        # Implementation varies by provider:
        # - OpenAI: Use /models endpoint metadata
        # - Anthropic: Query model info API
        # - Google: Use model discovery service
        # - Fallback: Conservative defaults with testing
        pass

    def _validate_capabilities(self, capabilities: dict) -> dict:
        """Validate discovered capabilities through empirical testing."""
        # Test actual limits by sending increasingly large prompts
        # Binary search to find true context window boundary
        # Account for safety margins and provider variability
        pass
```

#### Dynamic Budget Calculation
Calculate available context budget considering all context components:

```python
class ContextBudgetCalculator:
    """Calculate available context budget for different providers."""

    def calculate_budget(self, provider: str, current_context: list[Message]) -> int:
        """Calculate remaining context tokens for a provider."""
        total_limit = self.get_provider_limit(provider)
        used_tokens = self.count_tokens(current_context)

        # Reserve tokens for response generation (typically 25% of limit)
        reserved_for_response = int(total_limit * 0.25)

        available_budget = total_limit - used_tokens - reserved_for_response
        return max(0, available_budget)
```

#### Provider Selection Optimization
Route queries to optimal providers based on multiple factors:

```python
class ProviderSelector:
    """Select optimal LLM provider based on query characteristics."""

    def select_provider(self, query: str, required_tools: list[str],
                       complexity: str) -> str:
        """Select best provider for query execution based on dynamic capabilities."""

        # Estimate token requirements
        estimated_tokens = self.estimate_token_usage(query, required_tools)

        # Get available providers and their current context windows
        available_providers = self.get_available_providers()

        # Find providers that can handle the estimated token load
        capable_providers = [
            p for p in available_providers
            if self.get_context_window(p) > estimated_tokens * 1.2  # 20% safety margin
        ]

        if not capable_providers:
            # Fallback to providers with largest context windows
            capable_providers = sorted(
                available_providers,
                key=lambda p: self.get_context_window(p),
                reverse=True
            )

        # Select optimal provider based on complexity, cost, and performance
        return self.optimize_provider_selection(capable_providers, complexity)
```

### Integration with Dynamic Tool Management

#### Context-Aware Tool Selection
Tool selection considers provider context limits:

- **Budget-Constrained Selection**: Choose tools that fit within available context budget
- **Progressive Tool Loading**: Load tools incrementally based on query evolution
- **Fallback Tool Sets**: Maintain minimal tool sets for low-context scenarios
- **Tool Token Estimation**: Accurately estimate token usage for tool definitions and parameters

#### Adaptive Context Management
Dynamic adjustment based on context utilization:

- **Context Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of context usage during conversations
- **Tool Pruning**: Remove unused tools when approaching context limits
- **Query Decomposition**: Break complex queries into smaller, context-appropriate chunks
- **Context Compression**: Apply compression techniques when context limits are near

### Performance Optimization

#### Token Efficiency Metrics
- **Context Utilization Rate**: Percentage of context window effectively used
- **Token Efficiency Score**: Useful tokens vs total tokens consumed
- **Provider Cost Efficiency**: Cost per useful token across providers
