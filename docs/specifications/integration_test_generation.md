# Integration Test Scenario Generation

## Summary
DevSynth scaffolds integration tests from scenario descriptions to expand coverage.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/integration_test_generation.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/integration_test_generation.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.

Developers need quick placeholders for complex interactions so integration gaps are visible early.

## Specification
- `TestAgent.process` accepts an ``integration_scenarios`` list.
- Each scenario name is combined with ``integration_test_names`` when scaffolding tests.
- The agent uses ``devsynth.testing.generation.scaffold_integration_tests`` to create placeholders.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Providing ``integration_scenarios`` yields a placeholder test module for each scenario.
- Returned mapping keys correspond to the sanitized scenario names.
