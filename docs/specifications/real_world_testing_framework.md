# Real-World Testing Framework Specification

## Overview

This specification defines a comprehensive framework for validating DevSynth's end-to-end functionality through real-world application development scenarios. The framework simulates complete user journeys from requirements to working applications using DevSynth's EDRR (Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect) methodology.

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Functional Validation**: Verify DevSynth can create working applications from requirements
2. **User Experience Validation**: Ensure DevSynth interactions are intuitive and well-guided
3. **EDRR Methodology Validation**: Confirm adherence to the Expand-Differentiate-Refine-Retrospect approach
4. **Quality Assurance**: Validate generated code meets professional standards
5. **Release Readiness**: Provide evidence for v0.1.0a1 alpha release confidence

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Regression Prevention**: Catch breaking changes in core workflows
2. **Performance Baseline**: Establish performance expectations for different application types
3. **Documentation Validation**: Verify generated documentation accuracy
4. **Integration Testing**: Validate component interactions in realistic scenarios
