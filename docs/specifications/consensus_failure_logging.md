title: Consensus failure logging
version: 0.1.0-alpha.1

# Summary

When WSDE teams attempt a consensus vote that does not yield a completed decision, the system should log the failure and fall back to the more robust consensus-building process.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

Consensus votes may fail to produce a decision due to ties or incomplete participation. Without explicit logging, these failures are hard to diagnose, and downstream processes cannot distinguish between successful votes and silent fallbacks.

## Specification

- `WSDE.run_consensus` logs a consensus failure using `log_consensus_failure` when `consensus_vote` returns without a completed decision.
- The logged error includes the task identifier.
- After logging, `run_consensus` invokes `build_consensus` and attaches the result under the `consensus` key.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Given a WSDE team whose vote does not complete,
  when `run_consensus` is called,
  then the failure is logged via `log_consensus_failure`
  and the returned dictionary contains a `consensus` result.
