# WSDE-EDRR Collaboration Specification

## 1. Overview

This document specifies the collaboration expectations between the Worker Self-Directed Enterprise (WSDE) model and the EDRR
(Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect) methodology within DevSynth.

It defines phase progression requirements, memory synchronization behavior, and the mapping between peer-review outcomes and
EDRR results.

## 2. Phase Progression

1. Collaboration cycles must traverse phases in the order `EXPAND → DIFFERENTIATE → REFINE → RETROSPECT` unless explicitly
   rewound by the coordinator.
2. Each phase boundary triggers a role reassessment. The current role mapping MUST be accessible to external consumers.
3. Failed phase prerequisites halt progression and return control to the caller with diagnostic information.

## 3. Memory Flush Behavior

1. Memory updates are queued during phase execution and flushed when a phase completes.
2. A utility function **flush_memory_queue** exposes the queued operations and performs the flush. It returns the flushed items
   so callers may re-queue them to roll back the state if necessary.
3. A companion **restore_memory_queue** function accepts the returned items and re-queues them in their original order.
4. Retrospective phases MUST flush any remaining updates before reporting.
5. If flushing fails or no memory manager is configured, the coordinator emits a final
   sync hook with ``None`` so observers are not left waiting for state propagation.

## 4. Peer-Review Result Mapping

1. Peer-review processes yield one of: `approved`, `changes_requested`, or `rejected`.
2. These statuses map to EDRR results as:
   - `approved` → phase outcome is accepted and persisted.
   - `changes_requested` → phase outcome is stored but marked for rework in the next cycle.
   - `rejected` → phase outcome is discarded and the phase repeats.
3. The mapping is stored alongside review metadata to support traceability.

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/wsde_edrr_collaboration.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/wsde_edrr_collaboration.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.
