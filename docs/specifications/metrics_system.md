# DevSynth Metrics and Analytics System

This document outlines a best-practices approach for implementing a unified metrics and analytics framework in DevSynth, consolidating isolated metrics implementations into a coherent system.

## Current State Analysis

DevSynth currently includes several isolated metrics components:

1. **Basic Runtime Metrics** (`metrics.py`): Simple counters for memory and provider operations
2. **Phase Transition Metrics** (`PhaseTransitionMetrics`): Tracks EDRR phase transitions and quality metrics
3. **Ingestion Metrics** (`IngestionMetrics`): Monitors the ingestion process performance
4. **Alignment Metrics** (`alignment_metrics_cmd.py`): Analyzes alignment between requirements, specs, tests, and code
5. **Test Metrics** (`test_metrics_cmd.py`): Analyzes test-first development practices
6. **API Metrics**: Basic monitoring of API usage and performance

## Proposed Unified Metrics Framework

### Core Metrics Registry

Implement a central `MetricsRegistry` to serve as a single source of truth, supporting counters, gauges, histograms, and timers.

### Integration Strategy

Refactor existing components to register and emit metrics via the central registry. Define cross-component metrics for end-to-end workflows.

### User-Facing Features

- CLI `devsynth metrics` command for on-demand reporting
- Streamlit-based metrics dashboard in WebUI
- `/metrics/{category}` API endpoints for programmatic access

## Implementation Roadmap

| Phase | Goals |
|-------|-------|
| 1 | Build `MetricsRegistry`, define metric categories, setup storage backend |
| 2 | Refactor component-level metrics to use registry; implement cross-component metrics |
| 3 | Add CLI, WebUI, and API layers for metrics reporting |
| 4 | Integrate time-series storage and advanced analytics (trend analysis, predictions) |

By consolidating metrics in a unified system, DevSynth will provide comprehensive performance, efficacy, efficiency, and resource consumption insights to both technical and non-technical users.
