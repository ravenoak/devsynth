# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
  - Dialectical reasoning lacks a stable orchestrator and consensus handling.
- What proofs confirm the solution?
  - Behavior tests and unit tests exercise the reasoning loop and consensus failure logging.

## Motivation
Ensure reasoning tasks can reach consensus and persist results while gracefully handling failures.
The reasoning loop must integrate with EDRR and memory services.
## Specification
### DialecticalReasoner

- Delegates reasoning to an EDRR coordinator.
- Accepts a critic agent and optional memory integration component.
- Logs consensus failures without interrupting execution.
## Acceptance Criteria
- Reasoning runs through the EDRR coordinator with a critic agent.
- Consensus failures are logged and surfaced for audit.
- Reasoning results are returned or ``None`` on failure without raising.
