# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
  Dialectical reasoning utilities exist but are not fully integrated into
  the EDRR workflow and lack persistence guarantees.
- What proofs confirm the solution?
  Unit and behavior tests show reasoning loops storing results and
  logging consensus failures.

## Motivation

The reasoning loop guides agents toward synthesis.  Without a finalized
process, consensus handling and memory persistence remain inconsistent.

## Specification

- Integrate dialectical reasoning loop into the EDRR coordinator.
- Add consensus failure logging and retry hooks.
- Ensure reasoning outcomes persist through the memory adapter.
- Expand unit tests for reasoning utilities and memory interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Dialectical reasoning results are persisted to memory in behavior tests.
- Consensus failures emit structured log messages.
- EDRR coordinator invokes the reasoning loop for relevant tasks.
