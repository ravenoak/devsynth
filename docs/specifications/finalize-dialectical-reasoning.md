# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
  Dialectical reasoning utilities exist but are not fully integrated into
  the EDRR workflow and lack persistence guarantees.
- What proofs confirm the solution?
  Unit and behavior tests show reasoning loops storing results and
  logging consensus failures.

## Motivation

The reasoning loop guides agents toward synthesis.  Without a finalized
process, consensus handling and memory persistence remain inconsistent.

## Specification

- Integrate dialectical reasoning loop into the EDRR coordinator.
- Add consensus failure logging and retry hooks.
- Ensure reasoning outcomes persist through the memory adapter.
- Expand unit tests for reasoning utilities and memory interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Dialectical reasoning results are persisted to memory in behavior tests.
- Consensus failures emit structured log messages.
- EDRR coordinator invokes the reasoning loop for relevant tasks.

## Termination Proof

Let ``R(d)`` denote the reasoning loop at recursion depth ``d`` with a
configured maximum depth ``max_depth``.

1. Define the variant function ``V(d) = max_depth - d`` where
   ``max_depth \in \mathbb{N}``.
2. Each recursive call increases ``d`` by ``1`` and therefore decreases
   ``V`` by ``1``.
3. ``V`` is a non‑negative integer and cannot decrease indefinitely;
   when ``V = 0`` the loop halts.
4. The loop may also terminate earlier when consensus is reached.

Thus ``R`` terminates after at most ``max_depth`` recursive steps and is
safe provided ``max_depth`` remains below Python’s recursion guard.
