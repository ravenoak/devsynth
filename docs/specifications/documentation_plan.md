# DevSynth Documentation Plan

This document defines the unified documentation strategy for DevSynth, consolidating post-MVP docs, cleanup checklists, and metadata standards into a coherent roadmap.

## Strategy Overview

- **Documentation Hierarchy**: Clear separation between user guides (`docs/user_guides/`), developer guides (`docs/developer_guides/`), architecture (`docs/architecture/`), specifications (`docs/specifications/`), and roadmap (`docs/roadmap/`).
- **Metadata Standards**: Enforce YAML front-matter (title, author, date, version, status, release_phase, related_docs, tags) in all markdown files.
- **Progress Tracking**: Maintain `docs/DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_PROGRESS.md` as the single source of truth for ongoing cleanup efforts.
- **Index & Validation**: Automate `docs/documentation_index.md` generation and enable CI validation of metadata, links, and code snippets.

## Action Items

1. Standardize metadata across all docs.
2. Generate `docs/documentation_index.md` (scripted).
3. Update YAML headers in legacy files.
4. Refer release phases in front-matter for roadmap and specs.
5. Integrate index validation in CI (`validate_documentation.yml`).
## Implementation Status

This feature is **planned** and not yet implemented.
