# DevSynth Application Technical Specification

## 1. Executive Summary

The DevSynth (Software Development Life Cycle Command Line Interface) is a modular, agent-based framework that leverages artificial intelligence to assist in software development processes. This specification defines a comprehensive system that acts as a collaborative AI pair programmer, accelerating development while maintaining human oversight and control.

The system implements a dialectical approach to software development, where specialized AI agents propose, critique, and refine solutions through structured workflows. By enforcing BDD/TDD practices and providing a systematic pipeline for development tasks, the DevSynth aims to improve code quality, reduce boilerplate work, and enhance developer productivity.

This specification resolves identified inconsistencies and gaps from previous analysis, providing concrete implementation details, architectural decisions, and a clear roadmap for development. The system will be implemented in Python 3.11 using Poetry 2.1 for dependency management, with pytest and pytest-bdd for testing.
