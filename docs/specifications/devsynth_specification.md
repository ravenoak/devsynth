# DevSynth Technical Specification

This document summarizes the latest highâ€‘level specification for the DevSynth project. It complements the detailed [DevSynth Specification MVP Updated](devsynth_specification_mvp_updated.md) document and is kept in sync with the implemented API.

## 1. API Overview

DevSynth exposes two FastAPI applications:

- **Internal API** (`src/devsynth/api.py`) providing `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints for basic monitoring.
- **Agent API** (`src/devsynth/interface/agentapi.py`) providing workflow endpoints such as `/init`, `/gather`, `/synthesize`, `/status`, `/spec`, `/test`, `/code`, `/doctor`, `/edrr-cycle` and an additional `/metrics` endpoint.

All endpoints require optional bearer token authentication when enabled via configuration.

## 2. Implementation Status

The API modules listed above are implemented and covered by unit and integration tests. Refer to the [Requirements Traceability Matrix](../requirements_traceability.md) for details on requirement coverage.

## References

- [src/devsynth/api.py](../../src/devsynth/api.py)
- [tests/behavior/features/workflow_execution.feature](../../tests/behavior/features/workflow_execution.feature)

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/devsynth_specification.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/devsynth_specification.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.
