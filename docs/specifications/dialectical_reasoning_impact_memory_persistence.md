# Impact Assessment Persists Results to Memory

## Problem

Impact assessments generated during change analysis were not consistently persisted, limiting retrospective analysis across EDRR phases.

## Solution

The dialectical reasoner stores impact assessments in the memory system with the associated EDRR phase. Memory persistence failures are logged but do not interrupt assessment.

## Verification

- Behavior test: assessing a requirement change stores the impact assessment with phase `REFINE`.
- Behavior test: memory persistence failure logs a warning without interrupting assessment.
