# Complete Project Lifecycle

This specification formalizes the expected orchestration flow from project
initialization through execution, recovery, and completion inside the
LangGraph-backed workflow engine. It captures the behaviors that DevSynth must
exercise to progress a project through its lifecycle, including success paths,
retry semantics, failure handling, and cancellation.

## Socratic Checklist

- **What is the problem?** Without an explicit lifecycle specification, tests
  and automation could drift from the intended behavior of the workflow engine
  that coordinates DevSynth projects.
- **What proofs confirm the solution?** Unit tests execute end-to-end lifecycle
  scenarios on the `LangGraphWorkflowEngine`, covering completion, retry, and
  cancellation paths.

## Specification

1. Projects are instantiated through `LangGraphWorkflowEngine.create_workflow`
   with metadata capturing creation and update timestamps.
2. Steps added via `add_step` must be executed sequentially. Each step
   integrates with the orchestration service that drives agents and collects
   messages.
3. Execution must support:
   - Successful completion when all steps run without error.
   - Failure detection when a step raises an exception, surfacing the failure
     state to callers.
   - Retry logic honoring `max_retries` provided through the execution context.
   - Cooperative cancellation before the first step when `is_cancelled` is set,
     resulting in a paused workflow state.
   - Streaming callbacks for progress notifications while steps execute.
4. Lifecycle events append progress messages for auditability. Successful and
   failed runs must persist step-level status updates.

## Proof

- **Unit coverage** â€“ The lifecycle behaviors are exercised by
  [`tests/unit/orchestration/test_graph_transitions_and_controls.py`](../../tests/unit/orchestration/test_graph_transitions_and_controls.py),
  which verifies completion, failure handling, retry flows, streaming callbacks,
  and cooperative cancellation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Lifecycle operations expose completion, failure, retry, and cancellation
  states through the workflow result.
- Streaming observers receive events while steps run, ensuring dashboards and
  logs can mirror lifecycle changes.
- Cancellation prevents step execution, preserving system resources.

- Workflow engine implementation:
  [`src/devsynth/adapters/orchestration/langgraph_adapter.py`](../../src/devsynth/adapters/orchestration/langgraph_adapter.py)
- Lifecycle unit tests:
  [`tests/unit/orchestration/test_graph_transitions_and_controls.py`](../../tests/unit/orchestration/test_graph_transitions_and_controls.py)
- Dialectical audit traceability:

## Dialectical Audit Alignment

- The lifecycle specification now participates in the dialectical audit
  matrix, closing the prior question that marked it as documented without
  executable proof.
- The accompanying implementation report reiterates the lifecycle evidence
  and cites the orchestration adapter and unit test exercising the
  LangGraph workflow engine end-to-end (see
  [`docs/implementation/dialectical_audit_traceability_report.md`](../implementation/dialectical_audit_traceability_report.md#requirements-and-lifecycle-workflows)).
