# Test Agent Executes Generated Tests

## Summary
TestAgent can execute generated tests and surfaces failures when requirements are not met.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation
Developers need immediate feedback that placeholder tests failing due to unmet requirements are executed.

## Specification
- `TestAgent.run_tests` delegates to `devsynth.testing.run_tests.run_tests` to execute a test target.
- If any test fails, the method raises `DevSynthError`.
- On success, the method returns combined output of the test run.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Running tests with at least one failing test raises `DevSynthError`.
- Running tests where all pass returns the test output without raising.
