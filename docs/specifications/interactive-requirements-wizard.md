# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

This companion entry mirrors the canonical [`Interactive Requirements Wizard`](interactive_requirements_wizard.md) specification and records the traceability evidence that promotes the flow from draft to review status.

## What proofs confirm the solution?

- Canonical behavior coverage lives alongside [`interactive_requirements_wizard.md`](interactive_requirements_wizard.md) and is exercised by [`tests/behavior/features/interactive_requirements_wizard.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/interactive_requirements_wizard.feature) plus the shared navigation scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/general/requirements_wizard_navigation.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/requirements_wizard_navigation.feature).
- Supporting unit evidence comes from [`tests/unit/application/requirements/test_interactions.py`](../../tests/unit/application/requirements/test_interactions.py) and [`tests/unit/application/requirements/test_wizard.py`](../../tests/unit/application/requirements/test_wizard.py), which verify persistence, logging, and failure paths.
