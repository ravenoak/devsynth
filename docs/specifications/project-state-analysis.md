# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation
Project contributors need visibility into a repository's structure and architectural alignment to make informed decisions.

## Specification
- The system shall enumerate project files and categorize them by type.
- The system shall infer architectural patterns and provide confidence scores.
- The system shall compare requirements, specifications, and code to highlight misalignments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Running project state analysis produces a structured summary of project files and metrics.
- Detected architecture types include associated confidence scores and identified layers.
- Reports flag unmatched requirements, orphaned specifications, and unimplemented specifications.
