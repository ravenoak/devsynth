# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/promise_system_capability_management.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/promise_system_capability_management.feature) and [`tests/behavior/features/general/promise_system.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/promise_system.feature) run through [`tests/behavior/steps/test_promise_system_steps.py`](../../tests/behavior/steps/test_promise_system_steps.py), covering capability registration, promise creation, fulfillment, rejection, authorization failures, and promise chaining.
- Unit coverage in [`tests/unit/application/promises/test_promise_broker.py`](../../tests/unit/application/promises/test_promise_broker.py), [`tests/unit/application/promises/test_promise_agent.py`](../../tests/unit/application/promises/test_promise_agent.py), and [`tests/unit/application/promises/test_promise_store.py`](../../tests/unit/application/promises/test_promise_store.py) validates broker enforcement, state transitions, and persistence hooks.
- Integration checks in [`tests/integration/general/test_run_pipeline_command.py`](../../tests/integration/general/test_run_pipeline_command.py) and [`tests/integration/general/test_end_to_end_workflow.py`](../../tests/integration/general/test_end_to_end_workflow.py) confirm the promise system mediates agent capabilities within end-to-end workflows.


## Specification

- `PromiseBroker` registers agent capabilities with explicit constraints and enforces authorization on creation, fulfillment, rejection, and chaining operations.
- `PromiseAgent` exposes high-level helpers for creating, fulfilling, rejecting, and linking promises while delegating constraint enforcement to the broker.
- Promise metadata persists parameters, results, rejection reasons, and parent/child relationships for traceability and auditing.
- Unauthorized access raises `UnauthorizedAccessError` with structured diagnostics and avoids partial promise creation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Capability registration, creation, fulfillment, rejection, chaining, and unauthorized flows are covered by behavior suites using real broker and agent implementations.
- Promise state transitions persist metadata required for downstream orchestration (parameters, results, history, and parent/child links).
- Unauthorized operations do not create partial promises and surface descriptive errors to the caller.
