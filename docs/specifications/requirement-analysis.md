# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?

- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/requirement_analysis.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/requirement_analysis.feature) and [`tests/behavior/features/general/requirement_analysis.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/requirement_analysis.feature) validate file-based and interactive flows.
- Step bindings in [`tests/behavior/steps/test_requirement_analysis_steps.py`](../../tests/behavior/steps/test_requirement_analysis_steps.py) assert CLI command invocation and memory updates.
- Integration coverage in [`tests/integration/general/test_requirements_gathering.py`](../../tests/integration/general/test_requirements_gathering.py) verifies persistence of priorities and constraints captured by the wizard.

## Intended Behaviors

- **File ingestion** – Running `devsynth inspect --input requirements.txt` parses structured files, stores summaries in memory, and generates a Markdown report.
- **Interactive intake** – `devsynth inspect --interactive` starts a prompt-driven session that persists gathered data to the memory store and summary artifacts.
- **Config synchronization** – Requirements gathered interactively update `.devsynth/project.yaml`, aligning with wizard-driven flows.


## Specification

## Acceptance Criteria

- `devsynth inspect --input <file>` parses the specified document, executes the `inspect` command, and writes a requirements summary file.
- `devsynth inspect --interactive` launches the interactive prompts, records responses in memory, and persists the resulting summary.
- Interactive runs update `.devsynth/project.yaml` with the gathered priority and constraints so subsequent commands observe the new state.
