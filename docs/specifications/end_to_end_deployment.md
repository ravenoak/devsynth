# End-to-End Deployment Script

## Summary
Provides a single command to deploy the DevSynth stack with environment validation.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation
Existing deployment utilities are fragmented and do not expose one clear entry point with pre-flight validation. A unified script reduces operational risk and standardizes checks.

## Specification
- A `deploy.sh` script resides under `scripts/deployment/`.
- The script refuses to run as the root user.
- Required commands `docker` and `docker compose` must be available.
- Environment file `.env.<environment>` must exist with `600` permissions.
- Allowed environments: `development`, `staging`, `production`, `testing`.
- On success the script builds images, starts the stack, and performs a health check.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Running the script as root exits with an error.
- Invoking the script inside a container lacking Docker reports that Docker is required.
- Providing an environment file with incorrect permissions results in a failure message.
