# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation
The WebUI core requires consistent rendering of dashboards, deterministic routing of queries, and standardized formatting of command output.

## Specification
- **Rendering**: The dashboard renderer shall obtain Streamlit lazily and produce navigation and content for selected TraceIDs without performing network I/O.
- **Routing**: The query router shall direct queries to memory adapters based on strategy (`direct`, `cross`, `cascading`, `federated`, `context_aware`) while annotating each result with its source store.
- **Formatting**: The command output formatter shall sanitize text, map message types to styles, and expose helpers to emit JSON, YAML, tables, and Rich panels.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Rendering utilities expose hooks for dependency injection and operate without network access.
- Routing utilities attach `source_store` metadata and support strategy selection.
- Formatting utilities respect message type conventions and support structured output formats.
