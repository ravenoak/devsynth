# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

As DevSynth operates in automated environments and integrates with external systems, reliable health monitoring and performance metrics are essential for:

- Proactive issue detection and resolution
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Operational visibility for production deployments
- Troubleshooting and debugging capabilities
- Capacity planning and resource management

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/agent_api_health_and_metrics.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/agent_api_health_and_metrics.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.
- Prometheus-compatible metrics enable integration with monitoring ecosystems.

## Specification

The Agent API provides comprehensive health and metrics endpoints for operational monitoring:

### Health Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Overall system health status
- `GET /health/detailed` - Component-level health breakdown
- `GET /health/dependencies` - External dependency health checks

### Metrics Endpoints
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus-compatible metrics export
- `GET /metrics/json` - JSON-formatted metrics for custom consumption
- `POST /metrics/reset` - Reset counters and histograms (development only)

### Health Response Format
```json
{
  "status": "healthy|degraded|unhealthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-29T15:30:00Z",
  "version": "0.1.0a1",
  "components": {
    "database": "healthy",
    "llm_providers": "healthy",
    "memory_system": "healthy"
  }
}
```

### Metrics Coverage
- Request count and latency by endpoint
- Error rates and types
- Memory usage and performance
- LLM provider response times
- Workflow execution metrics
- Cache hit/miss ratios

## Acceptance Criteria

- [X] Health endpoints return correct status codes (200 for healthy, 503 for unhealthy)
- [X] Metrics endpoints provide Prometheus-compatible output
- [X] Health checks include all critical system components
- [X] Response times for health checks are under 100ms
- [X] Metrics collection doesn't significantly impact system performance
- [ ] Alert thresholds configurable for different deployment environments (planned for future release)
