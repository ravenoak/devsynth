# Summary
Streamlit-driven WebUI surfaces the DevSynth CLI feature set with enhanced telemetry, UXBridge parity, and resilient feedback channels.

## Socratic Checklist
- **What is the problem?** Streamlit pages previously lagged behind the CLI by lacking coverage of long-running operations, UXBridge parity, and detailed feedback for command execution.
- **What proofs confirm the solution?** Behavior, unit, and property tests exercise the wizard state machine, CLI bridging, and error handling while invariants document remaining Streamlit gating.

## Motivation
Maintain functional parity with the CLI so that teams adopting the WebUI gain the same diagnostics, coverage-aware execution, and onboarding aids without leaving the browser experience.

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- High-level behavior scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/general/webui_integration.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/webui_integration.feature) describe progress indicators, CLI coverage, and responsive layout; their step definitions live in [`tests/behavior/steps/test_webui_integration_steps.py`](../../tests/behavior/steps/test_webui_integration_steps.py) and are registered by [`tests/behavior/test_webui_integration.py`](../../tests/behavior/test_webui_integration.py), which currently skips execution until Streamlit-backed end-to-end runs stabilize.
- Unit harnesses cover UXBridge parity and error funnels, ensuring command failures surface actionable hints in the UI ([`tests/unit/interface/test_webui_handle_command_errors.py`](../../tests/unit/interface/test_webui_handle_command_errors.py)).
- Targeted fast tests [`tests/unit/interface/test_webui_targeted_branches.py`](../../tests/unit/interface/test_webui_targeted_branches.py) and [`tests/unit/interface/test_webui_bridge_targeted.py`](../../tests/unit/interface/test_webui_bridge_targeted.py) exercise Streamlit question prompts, tracebacks, highlight routing, and progress-state thresholds. Running `pytest` with `--cov` against these suites records 22 % line coverage for `webui.py` and `webui_bridge.py`, demonstrating measurable progress over the prior 10 % baseline while highlighting remaining rendering gaps.【F:issues/tmp_cov_webui.json†L1-L1】【F:issues/tmp_cov_webui_bridge.json†L1-L1】
- Property-based checks guarantee the wizard navigation model converges and honors bounds even when Streamlit state mutates unexpectedly ([`tests/property/test_webui_properties.py`](../../tests/property/test_webui_properties.py)).
- Finite state transitions and telemetry invariants are summarized in [`docs/implementation/webui_invariants.md`](../implementation/webui_invariants.md), documenting coverage evidence and outstanding Streamlit dependency requirements.

## Specification
- Provide enhanced progress indicators for long-running commands, including estimated time remaining and subtask tracking.
- Render color-coded output streams so that success, warning, error, and informational messages mirror CLI styling.
- Surface detailed error guidance with documentation links and remediation hints whenever command execution fails.
- Deliver contextual help panes with examples and option coverage for each CLI command page.
- Maintain UXBridge integration so browser interactions and CLI usage stay synchronized.
- Keep layouts responsive when the browser window resizes, ensuring controls stay accessible.
- Expose the full CLI catalog inside the WebUI, offering dedicated, consistent forms per command.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Long-running operations display an enhanced progress indicator with estimated time remaining and visible subtasks.
- Command output is color-coded: success (green), warnings (yellow), errors (red), and informational messages (blue).
- Error dialogs include actionable suggestions and documentation references.
- Help overlays list command usage examples and cover all available options.
- UXBridge abstractions back each WebUI action so CLI and WebUI stay in sync.
- Layout adjusts responsively when resized without hiding command controls.
- Every CLI command page is available through the WebUI with consistent affordances.
