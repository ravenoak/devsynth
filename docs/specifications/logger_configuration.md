Feature: Logger Configuration

# Summary

Defines a project-level logger that normalizes `exc_info`, supports structured logging, and exposes helper utilities.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/logger_configuration.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/logger_configuration.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.

A consistent logging interface simplifies debugging and enables centralized log formatting.

## Specification
- Provide `configure_logging`, `get_logger`, and `setup_logging` helpers.
- Normalize `exc_info` values to prevent logging crashes.
- Expose consensus failure logging helper.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Calling `get_logger` returns a configured logger instance.
- Passing an exception to logging methods records stack traces without error.
