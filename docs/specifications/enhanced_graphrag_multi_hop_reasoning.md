# Enhanced GraphRAG with Multi-Hop Reasoning and Semantic Linking

## 1. Overview

This specification defines enhancements to the GraphRAG integration to address the "Meaning Barrier" and provide advanced multi-hop reasoning capabilities. Building on the existing GraphRAG foundation, these enhancements add sophisticated semantic linking, requirement-to-code traceability, and research-backed validation methods.

## 2. Purpose and Goals

The enhanced GraphRAG framework aims to:

1. **Break the Meaning Barrier**: Connect code "what" with business "why" through semantic linking
2. **Enable Complex Traceability**: Support multi-hop queries across the entire software lifecycle
3. **Provide Verifiable Reasoning**: Ensure all conclusions are traceable to source knowledge
4. **Enhance Context Quality**: Deliver richer, more relevant context for LLM reasoning
5. **Support Impact Analysis**: Enable accurate assessment of change impacts across systems

## 3. Core Problem Statement

The inspirational documents identify a "Meaning Barrier" where current systems understand what code does but not why it exists or what business requirements it fulfills. This enhancement adds semantic linking between requirements, design decisions, and implementation to bridge this gap.

## 4. Enhanced Knowledge Graph Schema

### 4.1 Extended Entity Types

## 10. Testing Strategy

### 10.1 Multi-Hop Reasoning Tests

```gherkin
Feature: Enhanced GraphRAG Multi-Hop Reasoning
  As a DevSynth developer
  I want GraphRAG to perform complex multi-hop reasoning
  So that agents can answer sophisticated questions about code relationships

  Background:
    Given the enhanced GraphRAG system is configured with multi-hop reasoning
    And a comprehensive knowledge graph with requirements, code, and tests
    And semantic linking is enabled and trained

  @multi_hop_traceability @research_validated @high_priority
  Scenario: Trace requirement through complete implementation chain
    Given a business requirement with ID "REQ-001"
    And the requirement is implemented across multiple functions
    And validated by several test cases
    When I ask "What code implements requirement REQ-001 and how is it tested?"
    Then the system should traverse multiple hops correctly
    And identify all implementing functions with >95% accuracy
    And find all validating tests with >90% accuracy
    And provide complete traceability path
    And explain the reasoning steps taken

  @impact_analysis @blast_radius @medium_priority
  Scenario: Calculate accurate blast radius for proposed changes
    Given a proposed change to a core API function
    And the function is used by multiple modules
    And affects several business requirements
    When I ask "What would be affected if I change this function signature?"
    Then the system should calculate the complete blast radius
    And identify all dependent functions, tests, and requirements
    And assess the risk level accurately
    And suggest mitigation strategies
    And provide effort estimation within 20% of actual

  @semantic_linking @meaning_barrier @high_priority
  Scenario: Bridge meaning barrier with semantic linking
    Given code comments and commit messages contain business intent
    And requirements describe business needs
    When the system analyzes semantic relationships
    Then it should link code to business requirements with >80% accuracy
    And identify intent-implementation alignment issues
    And suggest improvements for unclear code intent
    And maintain semantic links during code evolution

  @validation_framework @research_backed @critical
  Scenario: Research-backed validation confirms multi-hop improvements
    Given an enhanced GraphRAG system with multi-hop reasoning
    And a baseline GraphRAG system without enhancements
    And a test suite of complex multi-hop queries
    When both systems process the same queries
    Then the enhanced system should show >30% improvement in answer accuracy
    And provide more complete reasoning paths
    And maintain higher confidence scores
    And demonstrate better handling of semantic ambiguity
```

## 11. Requirements

- **EGRAG-001**: Multi-hop reasoning must achieve >85% accuracy on complex traceability queries
- **EGRAG-002**: Semantic linking must identify requirement-to-code relationships with >80% accuracy
- **EGRAG-003**: Impact analysis must calculate blast radius with >90% completeness
- **EGRAG-004**: Enhanced GraphRAG must improve over baseline by >30% on research benchmarks
- **EGRAG-005**: Integration must maintain backward compatibility with existing GraphRAG

## Implementation Status

This specification defines the **planned** enhancements to the GraphRAG framework. Implementation will proceed in phases with research-backed validation.

## What proofs confirm the solution?

- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/enhanced_graphrag_multi_hop_reasoning.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/enhanced_graphrag_multi_hop_reasoning.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions in multi-hop traversal guarantee termination.
- Empirical validation through comparative testing with traditional RAG approaches.
- Research-backed evaluation using semantic linking accuracy and multi-hop reasoning benchmarks.
- Validation against the "Meaning Barrier" through requirement-to-implementation traceability metrics.
