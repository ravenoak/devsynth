title: WebUI Dashboard Progress and Sanitization Guarantees
version: 0.1.0a1
---

# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation
Dashboards that operate without a live Streamlit runtime must still honor layout
toggles, deterministic routing, and telemetry hooks. Progress indicators should
produce sanitized status updates while emitting structured debug traces. These
expectations ensure the WebUI remains observable in fast test suites that rely
on stubs instead of the interactive framework.

## Specification
- **Layout Toggles**: The WebUI shall compute layout breakpoints from cached
  `session_state.screen_width` values and apply the resulting CSS (padding,
  sidebar width) before invoking the navigation router.
- **Router Invocation**: The router must be constructed exactly once per run
  with the active navigation map and execute immediately after layout styles are
  applied.
- **Progress Telemetry**: Progress indicators and subtasks shall sanitize all
  descriptive text, emit deterministic status markdown, and log each update via
  the module logger.
- **Bridge Sanitization**: `display_result` must sanitize payloads prior to
  delegating to Streamlit rendering helpers so that test doubles can assert on
  clean output.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Fast unit tests can run the WebUI without importing Streamlit and still verify
  CSS payloads, router invocations, and sanitized telemetry.
- Progress checkpoints produce sanitized status text, exercise subtask helpers,
  and capture debug messages for each update.
- Sanitization hooks execute before messages reach rendering APIs, preserving
  traceable evidence for security-critical outputs.
