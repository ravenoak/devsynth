title: Dialectical Audit Gating
version: 0.1.0-alpha.1
---

# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation
Unresolved dialectical audit questions allow inconsistent releases. A gate is needed to block releases until all questions are resolved.

## Specification
- `verify_release_state` reads `dialectical_audit.log`.
- The script exits with status `1` when the log is missing or the `questions` list is non-empty.
- When `questions` is empty, the script exits with status `0` and reports success.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Running `python scripts/verify_release_state.py` with an unresolved question in `dialectical_audit.log` prints the question and exits with `1`.
- Running the script with an empty `questions` list exits with `0`.
