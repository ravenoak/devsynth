title: WebUI Diagnostics Audit Logs
version: 0.1.0-alpha.1

# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation
The WebUI diagnostics page currently provides system checks but lacks visibility into dialectical audit logs. Developers need convenient access to audit information when diagnosing issues.

## Specification
The diagnostics page SHALL display the contents of the most recent `dialectical_audit.log` file. The log contents SHALL be presented within an expandable section labeled "Dialectical Audit Log". If the log file is absent, the page SHALL indicate that no audit logs are available.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The diagnostics page exposes the dialectical audit log in an expandable section.
- When the log file exists, its contents are shown.
- When the log file is missing, the page indicates that no audit logs are available.
- Integration tests cover both log-present and log-absent scenarios.
