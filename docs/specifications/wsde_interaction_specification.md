2. Proposal generation by assigned agent
3. Critique and counter-proposals by other agents
4. Synthesis of perspectives by Primus
5. Voting or weighted decision mechanism
6. Implementation of consensus decision


**Implementation**:

```python
class ConsensusDecision:
    def __init__(self, agents, decision_topic, decision_context):
        self.agents = agents
        self.topic = decision_topic
        self.context = decision_context
        self.proposals = []
        self.critiques = []
        self.votes = {}
        self.decision = None

    def collect_proposals(self):
        """Collect proposals from all agents."""
        pass

    def collect_critiques(self):
        """Collect critiques of each proposal."""
        pass

    def conduct_voting(self):
        """Conduct voting on proposals."""
        pass

    def synthesize_decision(self):
        """Synthesize final decision based on votes and critiques."""
        pass
```

### 4.2 Dialectical Reasoning

**Pattern**: Structured thesis-antithesis-synthesis process for problem-solving.

**Process**:

1. Thesis presentation by one agent
2. Antithesis development by another agent
3. Dialectical analysis by a third agent
4. Synthesis creation by Primus or Designer
5. Validation by Evaluator
6. Refinement based on feedback


**Implementation**:

```python
class DialecticalReasoning:
    def __init__(self, thesis_agent, antithesis_agent, synthesis_agent):
        self.thesis_agent = thesis_agent
        self.antithesis_agent = antithesis_agent
        self.synthesis_agent = synthesis_agent
        self.thesis = None
        self.antithesis = None
        self.synthesis = None

    def generate_thesis(self, problem_context):
        """Generate initial thesis."""
        pass

    def generate_antithesis(self):
        """Generate antithesis in response to thesis."""
        pass

    def generate_synthesis(self):
        """Generate synthesis from thesis and antithesis."""
        pass
```

### 4.3 Peer Review

**Pattern**: Systematic review of work products by peers.

**Process**:

1. Work submission by producing agent
2. Review assignment to one or more agents
3. Independent review execution
4. Feedback aggregation
5. Revision by original agent
6. Acceptance or further review


**Implementation**:

```python
class PeerReview:
    def __init__(self, work_product, author_agent, reviewer_agents):
        self.work_product = work_product
        self.author = author_agent
        self.reviewers = reviewer_agents
        self.reviews = {}
        self.revision = None
        self.status = "pending"

    def assign_reviews(self):
        """Assign review tasks to reviewers."""
        pass

    def collect_reviews(self):
        """Collect reviews from all reviewers."""
        pass

    def aggregate_feedback(self):
        """Aggregate feedback from all reviews."""
        pass

    def request_revision(self):
        """Request revision from author based on feedback."""
        pass
```

### 4.4 Role Rotation

**Pattern**: Dynamic reassignment of roles based on task needs and agent capabilities.

**Process**:

1. Task analysis by Primus
2. Capability matching with available agents
3. Role assignment proposal
4. Acceptance by assigned agents
5. Handover of responsibilities
6. Performance monitoring in new roles


**Implementation**:

```python
class RoleRotation:
    def __init__(self, agent_registry, task_context):
        self.agent_registry = agent_registry
        self.task_context = task_context
        self.current_assignments = {}
        self.proposed_assignments = {}

    def analyze_task_requirements(self):
        """Analyze task to determine role requirements."""
        pass

    def match_capabilities(self):
        """Match agent capabilities to role requirements."""
        pass

    def propose_assignments(self):
        """Propose new role assignments."""
        pass

    def execute_handover(self):
        """Execute handover of responsibilities."""
        pass
```

## 5. Coordination Mechanisms

### 5.1 Message Passing Protocol

**Purpose**: Enable structured communication between agents.

**Message Types**:

- **Task Assignment**: Delegation of work
- **Status Update**: Progress reporting
- **Information Request**: Knowledge seeking
- **Review Request**: Solicitation of feedback
- **Decision Request**: Request for decision input
- **Notification**: General information sharing


**Message Structure**:

```json
{
  "message_id": "unique-identifier",
  "message_type": "task_assignment",
  "sender": "agent-id",
  "recipients": ["agent-id-1", "agent-id-2"],
  "subject": "Brief description",
  "content": "Detailed message content",
  "metadata": {
    "priority": "high",
    "deadline": "ISO-timestamp",
    "context_references": ["ref-1", "ref-2"]
  },
  "timestamp": "ISO-timestamp"
}
```

### 5.2 Shared Memory Access

**Purpose**: Provide common knowledge repository for all agents.

**Access Patterns**:

- Read-only for reference information
- Read-write for collaborative artifacts
- Append-only for logs and history
- Transactional for critical updates


**Implementation**:

- Vector store for semantic search
- Graph store for relationship navigation
- Structured store for metadata and state
- Locking mechanisms for concurrent access


### 5.3 Workflow Orchestration

**Purpose**: Coordinate the sequence and dependencies of agent activities.

**Features**:

- Task dependency management
- Parallel task execution
- Synchronization points
- Exception handling
- Progress tracking
- Timeout management


**Implementation**:

- LangGraph-based workflow definitions
- Event-driven state transitions
- Persistent workflow state
- Human intervention hooks

### 5.4 Role Rotation and Consensus Workflow

**Purpose**: Distribute leadership while synthesizing group decisions.

**Workflow**:

1. Evaluate agents against task context and choose an unused expert as Primus.
2. Assign remaining roles to other agents in sequence.
3. Collect solutions from agents and synthesize a consensus from their contributions.
4. After each cycle, rotate the Primus role and reset usage flags when all agents have served.


## 6. Integration with Other Components

### 6.1 EDRR Integration

The WSDE multi-agent system integrates with the EDRR:

- **Expand**: Designer and Worker agents generate diverse approaches
- **Differentiate**: Evaluator and Supervisor agents analyze options
- **Refine**: Worker and Designer agents improve selected solutions
- **Retrospect**: All agents participate in review and learning


### 6.2 Memory System Integration

The WSDE multi-agent system leverages the hybrid memory system:

- Shared access to all memory stores
- Role-specific views and access patterns
- Agent communication history persistence
- Decision rationale documentation


### 6.3 Promise System Integration

The WSDE multi-agent system uses the Promise system for capability management:

- Role-specific capability requirements
- Capability verification for role assignment
- Authorization for sensitive operations
- Capability discovery for task matching
