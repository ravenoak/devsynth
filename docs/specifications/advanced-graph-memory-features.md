# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation
The graph memory adapter lacked a formally specified way to walk the graph and
no guarantee that links between nodes persisted after storage and retrieval.
Agents therefore could not rely on neighbourhood exploration or durable
relationships across restarts.

## Specification

1. The adapter SHALL persist `related_to` relationships as RDF triples in both
   directions whenever a memory item is stored.
2. Retrieval SHALL surface all `related_to` links as a list of node identifiers
   in the item's metadata.
3. The adapter SHALL expose `traverse(start_id, depth)` which performs a
   breadth‑first search through the RDF graph up to the specified depth,
   returning visited nodes and edges.
4. Traversal SHALL delegate to `knowledge_graph_utils.traverse_graph`, which
   issues bounded SPARQL queries to the underlying `RDFLibStore` and raises a
   `MemoryStoreError` if a graph backend is unavailable.

## Proof

- Behaviour scenarios in
  `tests/behavior/features/general/advanced_graph_memory_features.feature`
  demonstrate that traversal returns the expected nodes and links and that
  retrieved items retain their `related_to` metadata.
- Existing unit tests for `knowledge_graph_utils.get_subgraph` provide baseline
  coverage for the traversal helper used by the adapter.

## Termination and Complexity

Breadth‑first search is bounded by the finite depth `d`. Each level explores the
frontier of yet‑unvisited nodes, and because the RDFLib store is finite the
algorithm halts after at most `d` iterations. The exploration cost is
`O(E)` with respect to the edges in the visited subgraph.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Storing an item with `related_to` metadata results in bidirectional RDF
  triples.
- Retrieving the item yields a `related_to` list matching the stored
  relationships.
- Calling `traverse` returns nodes and edges reachable within the supplied
  depth.
- Behaviour and unit tests exercising these features pass for all configured
  memory backends.
