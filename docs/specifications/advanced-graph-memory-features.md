# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
  The graph memory system stores items as RDF triples but lacks explicit
  traversal capabilities and documented guarantees that nodes and links
  persist across adapter restarts.
- What proofs confirm the solution?
  Behavioural tests traverse stored relationships and reload the adapter to
  verify that previously persisted nodes and links remain accessible.

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/advanced_graph_memory_features.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/advanced_graph_memory_features.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.


Agents reason over relationships between memories.  Without a bounded
traversal mechanism and durable graph storage, agents cannot reliably follow
chains of related items or resume reasoning after a restart.  Providing a
documented traversal API with persistence guarantees enables richer memory
queries and long‑lived reasoning across all supported backends.

## Specification

- Add a `traverse_graph(start_id, max_depth)` method to
  `GraphMemoryAdapter`.  The method performs a breadth‑first search over
  `devsynth:relatedTo` links, returning the set of reachable node IDs up to
  the specified depth.
- Persist nodes and relationships to `graph_memory.ttl` whenever items or
  links are stored.  On initialization the adapter loads the file if it
  exists, ensuring all nodes and `relatedTo` edges survive process restarts.
- Expose traversal and persistence behaviours through behaviour‑driven tests
  exercising graph traversal, reload cycles, and integration with other
  memory stores.

### Termination reasoning

The traversal algorithm employs breadth‑first search with an explicit depth
limit and a visited set.  Each iteration processes only unvisited nodes and
decrements the remaining depth, guaranteeing termination for any finite
graph and preventing cycles from causing infinite loops.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `GraphMemoryAdapter.traverse_graph` returns all nodes reachable within the
  requested depth and excludes the starting node.
- Reloading the adapter from a previously persisted graph reproduces all
  stored nodes and `relatedTo` links.
- Behavioural tests cover traversal and persistence across TinyDB and
  ChromaDB backends and pass under the `fast` marker.

## Proofs

- `advanced_graph_memory_features.feature` scenarios demonstrate traversal
  from an initial node through multiple hops and verify persistence after
  adapter reload.
- Unit and integration tests execute without errors for all memory backends.
