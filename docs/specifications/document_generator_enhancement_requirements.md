# DevSynth Documentation Generator Requirements

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

Create a documentation generation system that integrates with the DevSynth framework to automatically produce comprehensive project documentation from code, tests, specifications, and other project artifacts.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Software documentation is often:
- Inconsistent or incomplete
- Out of sync with the actual code
- Time-consuming to create and maintain
- Varying in quality and comprehensiveness

### 1.3 Vision

A system that maintains up-to-date, comprehensive documentation throughout the software development lifecycle by leveraging the existing DevSynth infrastructure and LLM capabilities.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Document Generation

- **FR-1**: Generate README files from project metadata and code analysis
- **FR-2**: Create API documentation from code and docstrings
- **FR-3**: Produce user guides based on application functionality
- **FR-4**: Generate architecture diagrams from code structure
- **FR-5**: Create sequence diagrams from workflow definitions
- **FR-6**: Maintain traceability between requirements and implementation

### 2.2 Documentation Management

- **FR-7**: Track documentation versions alongside code versions
- **FR-8**: Identify outdated documentation based on code changes
- **FR-9**: Suggest updates when code and documentation diverge
- **FR-10**: Support multiple documentation formats (Markdown, HTML, PDF)
- **FR-11**: Organize documentation in a logical, navigable structure

### 2.3 Integration Capabilities

- **FR-12**: Integrate with DevSynth workflow system
- **FR-13**: Extract context from existing project artifacts
- **FR-14**: Support command-line interface consistent with DevSynth
- **FR-15**: Enable extension through plugins for additional document types

### 2.4 Customization

- **FR-16**: Allow configuration of documentation templates
- **FR-17**: Support organization-specific documentation standards
- **FR-18**: Enable inclusion/exclusion of specific documentation sections
- **FR-19**: Provide style customization for generated documentation

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Usability

- **NFR-1**: Documentation should follow consistent formatting and style
- **NFR-2**: CLI commands should follow DevSynth patterns and conventions
- **NFR-3**: Generated documentation should be accessible and readable
- **NFR-4**: System should provide helpful error messages for failed document generation

### 3.2 Performance

- **NFR-5**: Documentation generation should complete within 60 seconds for projects under 10,000 lines
- **NFR-6**: Incremental updates should process only changed files
- **NFR-7**: System should handle projects with up to 100,000 lines of code
- **NFR-8**: Documentation builds should be cacheable to improve performance

### 3.3 Reliability

- **NFR-9**: System should create backup copies before modifying existing documentation
- **NFR-10**: Failed generation attempts should not corrupt existing documentation
- **NFR-11**: System should validate generated documentation for completeness
- **NFR-12**: Document cross-references should be validated for accuracy

### 3.4 Security

- **NFR-13**: Generated documentation should not expose sensitive information
- **NFR-14**: System should comply with data protection regulations
- **NFR-15**: Document generation should work in airgapped environments when needed

### 3.5 Maintainability

- **NFR-16**: Code should follow DevSynth architectural patterns
- **NFR-17**: System should use consistent naming conventions and structures
- **NFR-18**: Features should be tested with automated tests
- **NFR-19**: Documentation generator should be well-documented itself

## 4. User Stories

### 4.1 Developer Perspective

- **US-1**: As a developer, I want to generate API documentation from my code so that other team members can understand my implementation.
- **US-2**: As a developer, I want documentation to update automatically when I change code so that docs stay current with minimal effort.
- **US-3**: As a developer, I want to see which requirements are implemented by which components so I can verify coverage.

### 4.2 Technical Writer Perspective

- **US-4**: As a technical writer, I want to customize documentation templates so that output matches our organization's standards.
- **US-5**: As a technical writer, I want to review and edit AI-generated content before publication so I can ensure quality.
- **US-6**: As a technical writer, I want to see which documentation needs updating based on code changes so I can prioritize my work.

### 4.3 Project Manager Perspective

- **US-7**: As a project manager, I want comprehensive documentation for deliverables without adding significant work for my team.
- **US-8**: As a project manager, I want to verify that all requirements are documented so that I can ensure completeness.
- **US-9**: As a project manager, I want to generate high-level diagrams for stakeholder communication.

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Integration Requirements

- **TR-1**: Implement a DocumentationAgent for the DevSynth agent system
- **TR-2**: Create necessary workflows for document generation and maintenance
- **TR-3**: Define interfaces for document generation plugins
- **TR-4**: Implement port for documentation subsystem following hexagonal architecture

### 5.2 Implementation Requirements

- **TR-5**: Support Markdown as primary documentation format
- **TR-6**: Use Mermaid or PlantUML for diagram generation
- **TR-7**: Implement template system using Jinja2
- **TR-8**: Store document metadata in project configuration
- **TR-9**: Track documentation versioning through Git integration

### 5.3 Quality Requirements

- **TR-10**: Implement linting for generated documentation
- **TR-11**: Validate links and references in generated documents
- **TR-12**: Create test suite for documentation generation features
- **TR-13**: Support CI/CD integration for automated documentation builds

## 6. Constraints and Assumptions

### 6.1 Constraints

- Must integrate with existing DevSynth architecture
- Must support Python projects initially, with extensibility for other languages
- Must generate documentation compatible with GitHub and similar platforms
- Must not require external services for core functionality

### 6.2 Assumptions

- Projects using the system follow standard Python project structures
- Users have basic understanding of DevSynth CLI patterns
- System has access to all project artifacts (code, tests, specifications)
- Generated documentation will be reviewed by humans before official use

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- Documentation generator successfully integrates with DevSynth CLI
- Generated README files cover all essential project information
- API documentation accurately reflects code structure and interfaces
- Diagrams correctly represent system architecture and workflows
- Documentation updates when code changes are detected
- System handles errors gracefully with helpful messages
- Performance meets requirements for specified project sizes
