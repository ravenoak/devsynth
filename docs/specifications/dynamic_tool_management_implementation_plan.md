# Dynamic Tool Management Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This implementation plan outlines the integration of dynamic tool management concepts from "The Scaling Dilemma: A Critical Examination of Intelligent Tool Management in Large Language Models" into DevSynth. The plan addresses the critical insight that static tool exposure leads to cognitive overload and performance degradation, implementing a comprehensive solution that extends DevSynth's existing RAG+ and context engineering frameworks.

## Critical Success Factors

### Problem Statement
DevSynth currently exposes all registered tools (currently 4, but growing) to LLMs simultaneously. Research shows this approach leads to:
- 13.9%-85% performance degradation with increased context length
- Cognitive overload from tool proliferation
- Inefficient context window utilization
- Scaling limitations as tool ecosystem expands

### Solution Approach
Implement ToolRAG (Tool Retrieval-Augmented Generation) extending DevSynth's existing context engineering framework with:
- Dynamic tool scoping based on query analysis
- Hierarchical tool organization
- Architectural decoupling of tool selection from reasoning
- Robust error handling and continuous improvement loops

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

#### 1.1 Tool Corpus Creation and Indexing
**Objective**: Extend existing RAG+ infrastructure for tool management

**Tasks**:
- Create tool metadata schema with capabilities, usage patterns, and examples
- Extend ChromaDB vector store for tool definition indexing
- Implement hybrid search (semantic + keyword) for tool retrieval
- Add tool dependency mapping using NetworkX graph structures

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
# Extend existing RAG+ infrastructure
class ToolCorpus:
    def __init__(self, vector_store, graph_store):
        self.vector_store = vector_store  # ChromaDB for semantic search
        self.graph_store = graph_store    # NetworkX for relationships

    def index_tool(self, tool_name: str, metadata: ToolMetadata):
        # Index tool definition with embeddings
        # Map tool relationships and dependencies
        pass
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Tool corpus indexes all current tools with metadata
- Retrieval returns relevant tools for sample queries
- Performance maintains existing RAG+ benchmarks

#### 1.2 Basic Dynamic Scoping
**Objective**: Implement query-aware tool filtering

**Tasks**:
- Create query analysis module for capability identification
- Implement basic tool relevance scoring
- Modify `get_available_tools()` to accept query context
- Add performance monitoring for tool selection

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
# Modify agent workflow
def get_contextual_tools(query: str, available_tools: list) -> list:
    """Return tools relevant to the query."""
    capabilities = analyze_query_capabilities(query)
    relevant_tools = filter_tools_by_capabilities(available_tools, capabilities)
    return relevant_tools[:MAX_TOOLS_PER_QUERY]  # Limit exposure
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Tool exposure reduced from static list to <10 tools per query
- Query analysis identifies correct tool categories
- Agent functionality preserved with filtered tool sets

#### 1.3 Analytics and Monitoring
**Objective**: Establish baseline metrics for tool management

**Tasks**:
- Implement tool usage analytics (success rates, selection accuracy)
- Add cognitive load metrics (context window utilization)
- **Create Dynamic Provider Context Window Registry**: Implement automatic discovery and tracking of context limits for all LLM providers
- **Implement Context Window Discovery**: Automatically detect provider limits through API introspection
- Create performance monitoring for tool-related operations
- Establish baseline measurements before optimization

**Success Criteria**:
- Comprehensive analytics dashboard for tool performance
- Context window registry tracks all supported providers
- Automatic discovery prevents manual configuration errors
- Baseline metrics captured for all tool operations
- Monitoring identifies current performance bottlenecks

### Phase 2: Optimization (Weeks 5-8)

#### 2.1 Hierarchical Tool Organization
**Objective**: Implement structured tool taxonomy and retrieval

**Tasks**:
- Design tool hierarchy (Domain → Category → Capability → Tool)
- Implement coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy
- Add progressive disclosure of tool details
- Create tool relationship mapping

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
# Tool hierarchy structure
TOOL_HIERARCHY = {
    "development": {
        "code_execution": ["run_tests", "security_audit"],
        "analysis": ["alignment_metrics", "doctor"],
        "documentation": ["generate_docs", "validate_specs"]
    },
    "deployment": {
        "containerization": ["build_image", "deploy_k8s"],
        "configuration": ["validate_config", "generate_secrets"]
    }
}
```

```python
# Advanced retrieval pipeline with context awareness
class ToolRAG:
    def retrieve_tools(self, query: str, provider_context_limit: int) -> list[ToolMetadata]:
        # 1. Query decomposition
        sub_queries = decompose_query(query)

        # 2. Parallel retrieval from knowledge + application corpora
        candidates = self.hybrid_search(sub_queries)

        # 3. Cross-encoder reranking
        ranked_tools = self.cross_encoder_rerank(candidates, query)

        # 4. Context window-aware filtering
        context_budget = self.calculate_context_budget(provider_context_limit)
        final_tools = self.select_context_aware(ranked_tools, context_budget)

        return final_tools
```

**Success Criteria**:

    def select_tools_for_capability(self, capability: str, context: dict,
                                  provider_context_limit: int) -> list[str]:
        """Map abstract capabilities to concrete tool implementations with context awareness."""
        # Consider provider limits when selecting tools
        available_budget = self.calculate_available_budget(provider_context_limit, context)
        return self.select_tools_within_budget(capability, available_budget)

class ToolProxy:
    """Proxy layer that filters and routes tool requests with context awareness."""

    def intercept_tool_request(self, query: str, provider_info: dict) -> list[str]:
        """Analyze query and return only relevant tool names within dynamically discovered context limits."""
        # Context limit is dynamically discovered and provided by caller
        context_limit = provider_info.get('context_window', 4096)  # Conservative fallback
        return self.select_context_aware_tools(query, context_limit)
```

    def __init__(self):
        self.provider_registry = {}  # Dynamically populated through discovery
        self.discovery_cache = {}    # Cache discovered limits with TTL

    def get_available_budget(self, provider: str, current_context_tokens: int) -> int:
        """Calculate remaining context budget for a provider using dynamic limits."""
        total_limit = self._get_dynamic_limit(provider)
        return max(0, total_limit - current_context_tokens)

    def _get_dynamic_limit(self, provider: str) -> int:
        """Get context limit through dynamic discovery."""
        # Check cache first
        if provider in self.discovery_cache and self._is_cache_fresh(provider):
            return self.discovery_cache[provider]

        # Discover limit dynamically
        limit = self._discover_context_limit(provider)
        self.discovery_cache[provider] = limit
        return limit

    def select_optimal_provider(self, query_complexity: str, required_tools: list) -> str:
        """Select best provider based on query needs and tool requirements using dynamic limits."""
        estimated_tokens = self.estimate_token_usage(required_tools)

        # Get all available providers and their current context limits
        available_providers = self.get_available_providers()

        # Sort by context capacity (largest first)
        providers_by_capacity = sorted(
            available_providers,
            key=lambda p: self._get_dynamic_limit(p),
            reverse=True
        )

        # Select based on estimated needs with safety margin
        required_capacity = estimated_tokens * 1.2  # 20% safety margin

        # Find first provider that can handle the load
        for provider in providers_by_capacity:
            if self._get_dynamic_limit(provider) >= required_capacity:
                return provider

        # Fallback to largest available context window
        return providers_by_capacity[0] if providers_by_capacity else 'fallback'

                          context: dict) -> ToolRecoveryAction:
        """Analyze failure and determine recovery strategy."""
        if self.is_retryable(error):
            return RetryAction(delay=self.calculate_backoff(context))
        elif self.has_fallback(tool_name):
