# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/delegating_tasks_with_consensus_voting.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/delegating_tasks_with_consensus_voting.feature) and [`tests/behavior/features/general/delegate_task_consensus.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/delegate_task_consensus.feature) run through [`tests/behavior/steps/test_delegate_task_consensus_steps.py`](../../tests/behavior/steps/test_delegate_task_consensus_steps.py), demonstrating voting delegation, no-solution fallbacks, and dialectical error handling.
- Consensus utilities in [`tests/behavior/features/consensus_building.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/consensus_building.feature) and [`tests/behavior/features/general/wsde_voting_mechanisms.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/wsde_voting_mechanisms.feature) provide additional assurance that voting results integrate with consensus fallback logic.
- Unit coverage in [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_delegate_workflows.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_delegate_workflows.py) and [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_utils.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_utils.py) validates the coordinator's voting adapters and consensus summaries.
- Integration tests in [`tests/integration/general/test_run_pipeline_command.py`](../../tests/integration/general/test_run_pipeline_command.py) confirm the command-line workflows expose the same delegation semantics used by the BDD suite.


## Specification

- Voting-capable teams delegate tasks through `WSDETeamCoordinator.delegate_task`, capturing vote tallies, contributing agents, and consensus results when a majority is reached.
- When no agent proposes a solution, the coordinator produces a structured "no solutions" response and records the failure reason.
- Dialectical reasoning exceptions are trapped and surfaced as graceful errors without leaving the system in an inconsistent state.
- All delegation results include metadata describing the applied method (e.g., `consensus_vote`, `fallback`) and contributor set.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Voting scenarios capture every agent's participation and produce consensus-approved results when possible.
- No-solution scenarios return deterministic explanatory payloads without crashing the coordinator.
- Dialectical reasoning failures surface friendly error messages while preventing partially committed results.
