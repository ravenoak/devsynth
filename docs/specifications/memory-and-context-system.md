# Summary
The DevSynth memory and context system couples a multi-layered memory hierarchy
with a lightweight context manager so that workflow state, task history, and
reference knowledge can be stored, retrieved, and shared across EDRR phases.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem? Iterative workflows require durable access to recent
  context, historical events, and long-lived knowledge, yet early adapters
  exposed ad-hoc stores without a consistent categorisation scheme.
- What proofs confirm the solution? Behavior scenarios verify that memory items
  land in the appropriate layer, that context values remain available after
  memory operations, and that updates to an existing identifier surface the
  latest content.

## Motivation
Maintaining high-quality prompts and decisions across the Expand, Differentiate,
Refine, and Retrospect phases depends on reliable recall of prior work. A
multi-layered memory structure mirrors cognitive models—short-term context for
active exchanges, episodic records for historic runs, and semantic knowledge for
reference material—while a dedicated context manager captures session metadata.
Normalising these APIs allows CLI flows, WebUI sessions, and automated agents to
share the same abstractions without duplicating bookkeeping code.

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in
  [`tests/behavior/features/memory_and_context_system.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/memory_and_context_system.feature)
  assert layer assignment, demonstrate context persistence, and confirm that
  re-storing an item with the same identifier returns the latest content.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.

## Specification
- `MultiLayeredMemorySystem.store` generates an identifier when none is provided
  and routes items to short-term, episodic, or semantic layers based on
  `MemoryType`. Re-storing an existing identifier updates the targeted layer.
- `MultiLayeredMemorySystem.retrieve` returns the most recent version of a
  memory item regardless of which layer holds it.
- `MultiLayeredMemorySystem.get_items_by_layer` exposes layer-specific views so
  that behavior tests can assert categorisation without peeking into internal
  dictionaries.
- `SimpleContextManager` offers `add_to_context`, `get_from_context`, and
  `get_full_context`, enabling scenarios to capture workflow metadata alongside
  memory operations.
- Context operations are orthogonal to memory writes so repeated stores do not
  purge previously captured key-value pairs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Items tagged `CONTEXT`, `TASK_HISTORY`, and `KNOWLEDGE` appear in the
  short-term, episodic, and semantic layers respectively.
- Requesting the full context after multiple updates returns all keys with their
  latest values.
- Re-storing an item with the same identifier replaces the prior content and
  the `retrieve` API surfaces the updated value.
- Behavior evidence under
  `tests/behavior/features/memory_and_context_system.feature` and associated
  steps exercises the contract without relying on implementation details.
