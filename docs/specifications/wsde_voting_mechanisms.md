# WSDE Voting Mechanisms for Critical Decisions

## Problem Statement

Critical decisions within a WSDE team require a fair and transparent process so that agent teams can resolve high‑stakes choices without single‑agent bias.

## Solution Overview

When a task marked as a critical decision is delegated to a WSDE team:

1. **Voting Initiation** – the coordinator initiates a vote among all team members.
2. **Majority Voting** – the default mechanism tallies each agent's vote and selects the option with the most votes.
3. **Consensus Fallback** – if votes are tied, the team attempts consensus building and records the outcome.
4. **Weighted Voting** – when domain expertise is provided, votes are weighted accordingly and the winning option reflects expertise.
5. **Audit Trail** – every voting session records agent votes, weights, and the final decision for later review.

## Requirements

- A task flagged with `type: "critical_decision"` and `is_critical: true` must trigger the voting workflow.
- Voting results must include the method used, individual votes, and the final winner.
- Tied votes must invoke consensus building and capture that fallback in the results.
- Weighted voting must prioritize agents with relevant expertise and expose weighting details.
- All voting attempts must be logged for diagnostics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Delegating a critical decision task returns voting results containing the selected option and vote counts.
- Tasks that yield tied votes produce a consensus result with documentation of the fallback.
- Weighted voting tasks demonstrate that domain experts can overrule a numerical majority.
- The system logs each voting attempt with sufficient detail to reconstruct the decision.

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- Pending BDD scenarios will verify termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.
