# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?

- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/recursive_edrr_coordinator.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/recursive_edrr_coordinator.feature) and [`tests/behavior/features/general/recursive_edrr_coordinator.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/recursive_edrr_coordinator.feature) exercise micro-cycle creation, integration, and recursion depth enforcement.
- Step bindings in [`tests/behavior/steps/test_recursive_edrr_coordinator_steps.py`](../../tests/behavior/steps/test_recursive_edrr_coordinator_steps.py) validate coordinator hooks, child-cycle tracking, and failure conditions.
- Recursion invariants are backed by [`tests/unit/methodology/edrr/test_reasoning_loop_invariants.py`](../../tests/unit/methodology/edrr/test_reasoning_loop_invariants.py) and property-based checks in [`tests/property/test_reasoning_loop_properties.py`](../../tests/property/test_reasoning_loop_properties.py).

## Intended Behaviors

- **Nested cycle orchestration** – Coordinators spawn micro cycles within each phase and integrate their outcomes back into the parent. Covered by [`tests/behavior/features/recursive_edrr_coordinator.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/recursive_edrr_coordinator.feature).
- **Depth limits** – Recursive invocation respects `max_recursion_depth` and surfaces failures when limits are exceeded. Verified by [`tests/behavior/features/recursive_edrr_coordinator.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/recursive_edrr_coordinator.feature).
- **Resource guards** – Micro cycles evaluate cost/benefit, quality, and resource constraints before launching, aligning with coordinator heuristics exercised in [`tests/behavior/features/general/recursive_edrr_coordinator.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/recursive_edrr_coordinator.feature).


## Specification

## Acceptance Criteria

- Creating a micro cycle within any macro phase links it to the parent cycle, tracks recursion depth, and merges its results back into the coordinator state.
- Attempts to exceed `max_recursion_depth` raise an error and do not spawn additional cycles.
- Micro cycle launch decisions honour resource, quality, and cost-benefit thresholds before execution proceeds.
