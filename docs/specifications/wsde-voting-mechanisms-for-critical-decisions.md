# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/wsde_voting_mechanisms_for_critical_decisions.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/wsde_voting_mechanisms_for_critical_decisions.feature) and [`tests/behavior/features/general/wsde_voting_mechanisms.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/wsde_voting_mechanisms.feature) execute via [`tests/behavior/steps/test_wsde_voting_mechanisms_steps.py`](../../tests/behavior/steps/test_wsde_voting_mechanisms_steps.py), covering weighted voting, tie fallbacks, and decision documentation.
- Consensus and delegation suites referenced in related specifications (`delegate_task_consensus`, `consensus_building`) ensure voting integrates seamlessly with consensus fallbacks and WSDE team operations.
- Unit suites such as [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_conflict_detection.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_conflict_detection.py), [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_utils.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_utils.py), and [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_summary.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_summary.py) validate weighted vote calculation, tie detection, and documentation utilities.
- Integration runs in [`tests/integration/general/test_end_to_end_workflow.py`](../../tests/integration/general/test_end_to_end_workflow.py) demonstrate that voting data flows through orchestration pipelines and persistence layers.


## Specification

- Voting workflows evaluate agent expertise weights, compute tallies, and record the full voting ledger with reasoning metadata.
- Tie detection triggers consensus fallback, capturing the fallback method (`consensus_synthesis`, etc.) and aggregated rationale.
- Weighted voting favors domain experts while keeping the weighting rationale auditable and transparent.
- Decision outcomes persist alongside audit metadata so downstream processes can justify critical decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Weighted, tie, and fallback scenarios produce structured results including contributors, weighting data, and decision rationale.
- Consensus fallbacks activate reliably when votes tie or fail, and the behavior suite verifies documentation of the fallback path.
- Decision records are retrievable with audit-ready fields for stakeholders and automation alike.
