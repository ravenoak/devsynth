# Dialectical Reasoning Persists Results to Memory

## Problem

Dialectical reasoning results were not consistently persisted, limiting retrospective analysis and reuse across EDRR phases.

## Solution

The dialectical reasoner stores generated reasoning in the memory system with the associated EDRR phase. When consensus evaluation fails, reasoning is still persisted for later inspection.

## Verification

- Behavior test: evaluating a requirement change stores the reasoning with phase `REFINE`.
- Behavior test: an invalid consensus response raises an error and stores the reasoning with phase `RETROSPECT`.

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/dialectical_reasoning_memory_persistence.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/dialectical_reasoning_memory_persistence.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.
