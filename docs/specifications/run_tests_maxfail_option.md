# Run Tests Maxfail Option

## Summary
Adds a `--maxfail` flag to `devsynth run-tests` allowing early termination after a set number of test failures.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- Pending BDD scenarios will verify termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.

Quick feedback loops benefit from stopping test execution after the first few failures, but the DevSynth CLI lacked this control.

## Specification
- The `devsynth run-tests` command accepts `--maxfail <n>`.
- The value is forwarded to pytest's `--maxfail` option.
- When omitted, behavior matches previous releases.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `devsynth run-tests --maxfail 1` stops after a single failing test.
- Invocations without `--maxfail` run all selected tests.
