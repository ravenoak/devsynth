# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- Pending BDD scenarios will verify termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.


Manual reviews miss configuration mistakes and hardcoded secrets. An automated scan helps enforce security policies before changes merge.

## Specification

The `policy_audit` script scans configuration and source files for patterns that violate security policy. Forbidden constructs include hardcoded passwords, secret keys, API tokens and debug flags. The script exits with status `1` and reports offending files when violations are found.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Running `python scripts/policy_audit.py` without violations reports success and exits with `0`.
- Running the script on a file containing `password=` reports the file and exits with `1`.
- The script supports scanning specific paths or the entire repository by default.
