# DevSynth Application Technical Specification - MVP Version

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical specification for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version of the DevSynth application. The MVP focuses on delivering core functionality that provides immediate value to developers while establishing a foundation for future expansion.

DevSynth is designed as a CLI application for a single developer, operating on their local machine. It streamlines software development by providing AI-assisted automation for key phases of the software development lifecycle. The MVP will focus on project initialization, basic requirement analysis, test generation, and simple code generation capabilities, with a clear path for expansion to more advanced features in future iterations.

This specification defines clear MVP boundaries, prioritizes features, simplifies the initial architecture while preserving extension points, and provides concrete implementation guidance for core functionality.

## 2. System Overview and Purpose

### 2.1 Vision Statement

DevSynth aims to enhance developer productivity by providing an AI-assisted command-line tool that automates routine aspects of the software development lifecycle while preserving developer agency and promoting best practices.

**MVP Focus**: Deliver a functional CLI tool for a single developer on their local machine that demonstrates value through basic project setup, requirement analysis, and test/code generation for simple Python modules.

### 2.2 Core Objectives

**MVP Objectives:**
1. Provide a simple, intuitive CLI interface for Python developers on their local machine
2. Automate basic project initialization with standard Python project structure
3. Support requirement analysis and specification generation for simple modules
4. Generate basic unit tests following test-driven development principles
5. Generate functional code that passes the generated tests
6. Maintain a consistent project context across multiple CLI invocations
7. Optimize token usage and implement cost awareness strategies
8. Ensure minimal resource usage, just what's required for each task
9. Provide appropriate security and privacy for a single-developer PoC

**Future Expansion Objectives** (not in MVP):
- Multi-agent collaboration for complex tasks
- Advanced code refactoring and optimization
- Comprehensive documentation generation
- Continuous learning from user feedback

### 2.3 Target Users

**MVP Target Users:**
1. Individual Python developers seeking productivity tools on their local machine
2. Developers familiar with command-line tools and basic DevSynth concepts
3. Developers with access to LM Studio running locally on their machine

The MVP will focus on serving these core users with straightforward use cases, with plans to expand to more diverse user groups in future versions.

### 2.4 Key Use Cases

**MVP Use Cases:**
1. Initialize a new or existing Python project with standard structure and configuration
2. Generate a basic specification from user-provided requirements
3. Create unit tests based on specifications
4. Generate functional code that satisfies the tests
5. Refine generated artifacts through iterative prompting

**Implementation Priority:**
- High: Use cases 1-4 (core project workflow)
- Medium: Use case 5 (iterative refinement)

## 3. Architecture and Component Design

### 3.1 High-Level Architecture

The MVP architecture follows a simplified layered approach with clear separation of concerns, designed to run entirely on a developer's local machine:

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**MVP Architecture Decisions:**
1. Single-agent design for MVP (multi-agent support as extension point)
2. File-based persistence for project context and memory
3. Simplified orchestration with linear workflows
4. Minimal but extensible LLM backend abstraction
5. Integration with LM Studio endpoint running locally on the developer's machine
6. All resources and operations local to the developer's machine

**Extension Points:**
- Plugin architecture for future command extensions
- Abstraction layer for LLM providers
- Hooks for future multi-agent collaboration
- Interface for alternative persistence mechanisms

### 3.4 Data Flow

**MVP Data Flow:**

1. **User Input → CLI Interface**
   - Command arguments and options
   - Input files and project paths

2. **CLI Interface → Orchestrator**
   - Validated commands and parameters
   - User preferences

3. **Orchestrator → Agent**
   - Task specifications
   - Project context
   - Previous outputs (when relevant)
   - Token budget constraints

4. **Agent → LLM Backend**
   - Constructed prompts
   - Context information
   - Token usage tracking

5. **LLM Backend → LM Studio Endpoint**
   - API requests
   - Model parameters

6. **LM Studio Endpoint → LLM Backend**
   - Generated text
   - Completion metadata

7. **LLM Backend → Agent**
   - Processed results
   - Token usage statistics

8. **Agent → Orchestrator**
   - Processed results
   - Validation status
   - Token usage report

9. **Orchestrator → CLI Interface**
   - Command results
   - Status information
   - Performance metrics

10. **CLI Interface → User**
    - Formatted output
    - Generated files
    - Error messages
    - Token usage summary

**Implementation Guidance:**
- Use dataclasses or Pydantic models for structured data passing
- Implement clear validation at each transition
- Log data flow for debugging purposes
- Track token usage at each step
- Optimize context size to minimize token usage

### 3.5 Unified UX Layer

DevSynth exposes a common `UXBridge` abstraction so that multiple user
interfaces can share the same workflows. The CLI, WebUI and Agent API all
communicate with the orchestration layer through this bridge.

<!-- Diagram: Unified interface through UXBridge -->
```mermaid

```

This unified layer ensures feature parity across interfaces and simplifies
testing.

## 4. Functional Requirements and Implementation Details

### 4.1 Project Initialization and Management

#### 4.1.1 Project Creation

**MVP Scope:**
- Initialize standard Python project structure
- Generate basic setup.py/pyproject.toml
- Create README template
- Set up basic .gitignore
- Initialize virtual environment (optional)
- Configure local LM Studio endpoint

**Implementation Guidance:**
- Use cookiecutter-like templates for project structure
- Support common project types (library, application, CLI)
- Validate project name against Python packaging standards
- Provide clear feedback on created artifacts
- Include configuration for LM Studio endpoint
- Minimize resource usage during initialization

**Future Extension Points:**

#### 4.1.2 `.devsynth/project.yaml`

**MVP Scope:**
- Basic configuration file (`.devsynth/project.yaml`)
- LM Studio endpoint configuration
- Project metadata storage
- Simple user preferences
- Token usage limits and tracking

**Implementation Guidance:**
 - Use YAML or TOML for configuration files. The loader relies on the `toml`
   package to read settings from `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.devsynth]`.
- Support environment variable overrides
- Validate configuration on load
- Provide sensible defaults
- Store configuration in project directory
- Include token usage tracking settings

**Future Extension Points:**
- Team configuration sharing

- Track command sequence for context building
- Record token usage per session
- Implement context pruning for token optimization

**Future Extension Points:**
- Cloud-based session synchronization
- Session branching and merging
- Advanced session analytics

#### 4.1.4 Interactive Init Workflow

**MVP Scope:**
