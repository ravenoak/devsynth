# GraphRAG Integration Specification

## 1. Overview

GraphRAG (Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation) represents a paradigm shift in how Large Language Models access and utilize knowledge. This specification defines the integration of GraphRAG capabilities into DevSynth, combining the power of knowledge graphs with LLM reasoning for enhanced code comprehension and generation.

## 2. Purpose and Goals

The GraphRAG integration aims to:

1. **Transform Static Knowledge into Dynamic Reasoning**: Move beyond simple text retrieval to graph-based knowledge traversal
2. **Enable Multi-Hop Reasoning**: Support complex queries that require traversing relationships between entities
3. **Provide Verifiable Grounding**: Ensure LLM responses are based on structured, auditable knowledge
4. **Scale Knowledge Access**: Handle large, complex codebases with efficient graph-based queries
5. **Enhance Context Quality**: Provide richer, more relevant context for LLM reasoning tasks

## 3. Core Concepts

### 3.1 GraphRAG vs. Traditional RAG

| Aspect | Traditional RAG | GraphRAG |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Knowledge Representation** | Unstructured text chunks | Structured graph with entities and relationships |
| **Query Mechanism** | Vector similarity search | Graph traversal and pattern matching |
| **Reasoning Capability** | Single-hop retrieval | Multi-hop relationship reasoning |
| **Verifiability** | Chunk-level relevance | Structured fact verification |
| **Context Quality** | Text snippets | Structured knowledge subgraphs |

## 4. Knowledge Graph Schema

### 4.1 Enhanced Code Ontology

Building on the inspirational documents, we adopt an enhanced code ontology that represents software projects as interconnected knowledge graphs:

```python
class CodeKnowledgeGraph:
    """Enhanced knowledge graph for software projects."""

    # Core Entity Types
    entities = {
        "Project": {
            "properties": ["name", "version", "language", "description"],
            "relationships": ["CONTAINS", "DEPENDS_ON", "USES"]
        },
        "Module": {
            "properties": ["name", "path", "type", "complexity", "lines_of_code"],
            "relationships": ["CONTAINS", "IMPORTS", "EXPORTS", "DEPENDS_ON"]
        },
        "Class": {
            "properties": ["name", "visibility", "abstract", "parent_classes"],
            "relationships": ["INHERITS_FROM", "IMPLEMENTS", "CONTAINS", "USES"]
        },
        "Function": {
            "properties": ["name", "signature", "visibility", "complexity", "test_coverage"],
            "relationships": ["CALLS", "CALLED_BY", "DEFINES", "USES", "TESTED_BY"]
        },
        "Variable": {
            "properties": ["name", "type", "scope", "initialized"],
            "relationships": ["DEFINED_IN", "USED_IN", "MODIFIED_IN"]
        },
        "Requirement": {
            "properties": ["id", "description", "priority", "status"],
            "relationships": ["IMPLEMENTED_BY", "TESTED_BY", "RELATED_TO"]
        },
        "Test": {
            "properties": ["name", "type", "framework", "coverage"],
            "relationships": ["TESTS", "USES", "DEPENDS_ON"]
        }
    }

    # Relationship Types with Semantics
    relationships = {
        "IMPLEMENTS": {"direction": "bidirectional", "description": "Code implements requirement"},
        "TESTS": {"direction": "unidirectional", "description": "Test validates functionality"},
        "CALLS": {"direction": "unidirectional", "description": "Function calls another function"},
        "INHERITS_FROM": {"direction": "unidirectional", "description": "Class inheritance"},
        "DEPENDS_ON": {"direction": "bidirectional", "description": "Dependency relationship"},
        "CONTAINS": {"direction": "unidirectional", "description": "Containment relationship"}
    }
```

### 4.2 Graph Construction Pipeline

        # Return confidence score
        pass
```

## 5. GraphRAG Query Engine

### 5.1 Query Processing Pipeline

Transform natural language queries into structured graph traversals:

```python
class GraphRAGQueryEngine:
    """Engine for processing GraphRAG queries."""

    def process_query(self, natural_language_query: str) -> GraphRAGResponse:
        """Process a natural language query using GraphRAG."""
        # Parse query for intent and entities
        parsed_query = self._parse_query(natural_language_query)

        # Resolve entities in the knowledge graph
        entity_mappings = self._resolve_entities(parsed_query.entities)

        # Plan graph traversal strategy
        traversal_plan = self._plan_traversal(parsed_query, entity_mappings)

        # Execute graph traversal
        subgraph = self._execute_traversal(traversal_plan)

        # Linearize subgraph for LLM consumption
        linearized_context = self._linearize_subgraph(subgraph)

        # Generate response with grounding

        pass

    def _resolve_entities(self, entities: List[str]) -> Dict[str, GraphEntity]:
        """Resolve entity names to graph nodes."""
        # Fuzzy matching against graph entities
        # Handle partial matches and synonyms
        # Return mapping of query entities to graph nodes
        pass

    def _plan_traversal(self, parsed_query: ParsedQuery, entity_mappings: Dict) -> TraversalPlan:
        """Plan optimal graph traversal strategy."""
        # Determine traversal pattern based on query type
        # Select appropriate relationship types
        # Plan multi-hop traversal when needed
        pass

    def _execute_traversal(self, plan: TraversalPlan) -> KnowledgeSubgraph:
        """Execute planned graph traversal."""
        # Perform graph database queries
        # Follow relationships according to plan

        # Construct prompt with graph-derived context
        # Include instructions for grounded reasoning
        # Generate response with source citations
        pass
```

### 5.2 Query Types and Patterns

Support various query patterns for different use cases:

| Query Type | Example | Traversal Pattern | Expected Response |
|------------|---------|------------------|------------------|
| **Entity Information** | "What does function X do?" | Single node + properties | Function description with context |
| **Relationship Query** | "What calls function X?" | One-hop traversal | List of calling functions |
| **Multi-Hop Query** | "What requirements are tested by tests that use function X?" | Multi-hop: Function → Tests → Requirements | Traceability chain |
| **Impact Analysis** | "What would change if I modify class Y?" | Reverse traversal from class | Affected components |
| **Pattern Discovery** | "Find similar code patterns to this function" | Similarity-based traversal | Pattern matches with examples |

### 5.3 Context Linearization Strategies

Convert graph structures into LLM-friendly formats:

```python
class ContextLinearizer:
    """Strategies for linearizing graph context for LLMs."""

    def hierarchical_linearization(self, subgraph: KnowledgeSubgraph) -> str:
        """Linearize following entity hierarchy."""
        # Start with high-level entities (Project, Module)
        # Follow containment relationships
        # Include properties and relationships at each level
        pass

    def task_oriented_linearization(self, subgraph: KnowledgeSubgraph, task_type: str) -> str:
        """Linearize based on task requirements."""
        # For code generation: focus on interfaces and dependencies
        # For debugging: focus on error patterns and fixes
        # For refactoring: focus on coupling and cohesion
        pass

    def citation_linearization(self, subgraph: KnowledgeSubgraph) -> str:
        """Linearize with explicit source citations."""
        # Include source file, line numbers, and confidence scores
        # Enable fact verification and traceability
        pass
```

    """Integration between GraphRAG and memory systems."""

    def enhance_memory_with_graph(self, memory_manager) -> None:
        """Add graph traversal capabilities to memory system."""
        # Use graph store for structured queries
        # Use vector store for entity similarity
        # Use document store for detailed context
        pass

    def query_across_memory_types(self, query: str) -> EnhancedContext:
        """Query across graph, vector, and document stores."""
        # Parse query for entity and relationship requirements
        # Use graph store for structural queries
        # Use vector store for semantic similarity
        # Use document store for detailed explanations
        pass
```

### 6.3 Agent System Integration

```python
class GraphRAGAgentEnhancement:
    """Enhance agents with GraphRAG capabilities."""

    def enhance_agent_reasoning(self, agent, graph_engine) -> None:
        """Add graph-based reasoning to agent."""
        # Provide agent with graph query capabilities
        # Enable multi-hop reasoning for complex tasks
        # Add fact verification and citation generation
        pass

    def support_multi_hop_queries(self, agent) -> None:
        """Enable agents to ask complex multi-hop questions."""
        # "What requirements are implemented by functions that call this API?"
        # "What tests need to be updated if I change this interface?"
        # "Find all code that depends on this deprecated function"
        pass
```

## 7. Implementation Details
