# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/multi_agent_collaboration.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/multi_agent_collaboration.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.


## Specification

## Acceptance Criteria

## Proofs

### Termination
Each of \(w\) tasks triggers at most \(n(n-1)\) message exchanges among \(n\) agents. The total number of steps is bounded by

\[
S = w \cdot n (n - 1)
\]

Because \(n\) and \(w\) are finite, \(S\) is finite, ensuring termination.

### Complexity
Communication complexity grows quadratically with the number of agents:

\[
T(n, w) = O(n^2 w)
\]

Hypothesis-based benchmarks (`tests/performance/test_multi_agent_benchmarks.py`) show 120 operations for \(n=4, w=10\) and 560 for \(n=8, w=10\), consistent with the formula.
