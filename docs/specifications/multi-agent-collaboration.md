# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/multi_agent_collaboration.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/multi_agent_collaboration.feature) and [`tests/behavior/features/general/wsde_agent_model.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/wsde_agent_model.feature) execute with the shared step definitions in [`tests/behavior/steps/test_wsde_agent_model_steps.py`](../../tests/behavior/steps/test_wsde_agent_model_steps.py), demonstrating peer-based collaboration, rotating primus roles, and consensus fallbacks across WSDE teams.
- Delegation workflows in [`tests/behavior/features/general/delegate_task.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/delegate_task.feature) exercise the same coordinator surfaces from the perspective of collaborative execution, ensuring delegation remains consensus driven.
- Unit suites such as [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_collaborative_wsde_team.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_collaborative_wsde_team.py), [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_delegate_workflows.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_delegate_workflows.py), and [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_summary.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_summary.py) validate role rotation, contribution accounting, and consensus summaries.
- Integration coverage in [`tests/integration/general/test_refactor_workflow.py`](../../tests/integration/general/test_refactor_workflow.py) confirms that collaborative teams execute within end-to-end DevSynth workflows.


## Specification

- The `WSDETeamCoordinator` and `WSDETeam` classes orchestrate multi-agent collaboration without fixed hierarchies, enabling any agent to propose or critique solutions.
- Leadership (Primus) selection is contextual: `WSDETeam.rotate_primus` and task delegation hooks choose the agent whose expertise best aligns with the current task load.
- Collaboration pipelines capture contributions, consensus decisions, and reasoning metadata via `build_consensus`, `summarize_consensus_result`, and contribution metrics stored on the team model.
- Dialectical reasoning and consensus utilities ensure multi-agent disagreements surface hooks that converge to a majority or consensus-backed output.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Teams rotate leadership based on task expertise and record role history.
- Delegation across agents remains consensus based, including dialectical review before final decisions.
- Collaboration logs track contributors, consensus results, and reasoning artifacts for downstream inspection.
- Behavior and unit suites above execute without skipped steps, demonstrating collaborative flows through the WSDE interfaces.
