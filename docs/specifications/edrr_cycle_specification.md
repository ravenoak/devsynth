## 4. Integration with Other Components

### 4.1 WSDE Model Integration

The EDRR cycle works in conjunction with the WSDE (Worker Self-Directed Enterprise) model:

- **Primus**: Coordinates the overall EDRR process and ensures alignment with goals
- **Worker**: Executes specific tasks within each EDRR stage
- **Supervisor**: Monitors progress and ensures quality across the EDRR cycle
- **Designer**: Focuses on creative aspects during Expand and Refine stages
- **Evaluator**: Leads the Differentiate and Retrospect stages

### 4.2 Memory System Integration

The EDRR cycle leverages the hybrid memory system:

- **Vector Store**: Retrieves relevant examples and context during Expand stage
- **Structured Store**: Maintains metadata about artifacts through the cycle
- **Graph Store**: Tracks relationships between artifacts and their evolution

### 4.3 Workflow Orchestration

The orchestration layer manages the EDRR cycle execution:

- Defines transition conditions between stages
- Handles parallel and sequential execution of tasks
- Manages state persistence across the cycle
- Coordinates human intervention points

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Coordinator Component

```python
class EDRRCoordinator:
    """Manages the execution of the EDRR cycle."""
    
    def __init__(self, memory_manager, agent_registry, workflow_engine):
        self.memory_manager = memory_manager
        self.agent_registry = agent_registry
        self.workflow_engine = workflow_engine
        self.current_stage = None
        self.cycle_context = {}
    
    def start_cycle(self, initial_context):
        """Begin a new EDRR cycle with the provided context."""
        self.cycle_context = initial_context
        self.current_stage = "expand"
        return self.execute_expand()
    
    def execute_expand(self):
        """Execute the Expand stage of the EDRR cycle."""
        # Implementation details
        pass
    
    def execute_differentiate(self, expand_results):
        """Execute the Differentiate stage of the EDRR cycle."""
        # Implementation details
        pass
    
    def execute_refine(self, differentiate_results):
        """Execute the Refine stage of the EDRR cycle."""
        # Implementation details
        pass
    
    def execute_retrospect(self, refine_results):
        """Execute the Retrospect stage of the EDRR cycle."""
        # Implementation details
        pass
    
    def transition_to_next_stage(self, current_results):
        """Transition to the next stage in the EDRR cycle."""
        # Implementation details
        pass
```

### 5.2 Stage-Specific Prompts

Each EDRR stage uses specialized prompts to guide agent behavior:

- **Expand Prompts**: Focus on divergent thinking and comprehensive exploration
- **Differentiate Prompts**: Emphasize analytical comparison and evaluation
- **Refine Prompts**: Guide iterative improvement and optimization
- **Retrospect Prompts**: Structure reflection and learning capture

### 5.3 Metrics and Evaluation

The EDRR cycle tracks performance metrics:

- **Diversity Score**: Measures the variety of approaches in Expand stage
- **Decision Quality**: Evaluates the effectiveness of Differentiate stage
- **Improvement Delta**: Quantifies enhancements during Refine stage
- **Learning Efficiency**: Assesses knowledge capture in Retrospect stage

## 6. Configuration Options

The EDRR cycle behavior can be customized through configuration:

- **Stage Weights**: Adjust emphasis on different stages
- **Iteration Limits**: Set maximum iterations for refinement
- **Quality Thresholds**: Define acceptance criteria for outputs
- **Human Intervention Points**: Configure when human input is requested

## 7. Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the EDRR cycle implementation:

- **Adaptive Stage Sequencing**: Dynamically adjust the process based on task characteristics
- **Parallel Sub-cycles**: Allow nested EDRR cycles for complex problems
- **Cross-project Learning**: Apply insights from previous projects to new contexts
- **Customizable Stage Templates**: Enable domain-specific EDRR variations

## 8. Conclusion

The EDRR cycle provides a structured framework for iterative development in DevSynth, enabling systematic exploration, evaluation, improvement, and learning. By integrating with the WSDE model and hybrid memory system, it supports collaborative, knowledge-driven software development.
