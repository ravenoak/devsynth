## 1. Overview

The EDRR (Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect) cycle is a structured workflow methodology implemented in DevSynth to guide the iterative development process. This specification defines the components, interactions, and implementation details of the EDRR.

The EDRR framework is implemented as a recursive, fractal structure where each macro-level phase (Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect) contains its own nested micro-EDRR cycles. This recursive approach enables self-optimization at multiple levels of granularity, creating a more adaptive and intelligent development process.

## 4. Integration with Other Components

### 4.1 WSDE Model Integration

The EDRR works in conjunction with the WSDE (WSDE) model:

- **Primus**: Coordinates the overall EDRR process and ensures alignment with goals
- **Worker**: Executes specific tasks within each EDRR stage
- **Supervisor**: Monitors progress and ensures quality across the EDRR
- **Designer**: Focuses on creative aspects during Expand and Refine stages
- **Evaluator**: Leads the Differentiate and Retrospect stages


### 4.2 Memory System Integration

The EDRR leverages the hybrid memory system:

- **Vector Store**: Retrieves relevant examples and context during Expand stage
- **Structured Store**: Maintains metadata about artifacts through the cycle
- **Graph Store**: Tracks relationships between artifacts and their evolution


### 4.3 Workflow Orchestration

The orchestration layer manages the EDRR execution:

- Defines transition conditions between stages
- Handles parallel and sequential execution of tasks
- Manages state persistence across the cycle
- Coordinates human intervention points


## 4.4 Recursive EDRR Structure

The EDRR implements a recursive, fractal structure where each macro phase contains its own nested micro-EDRR cycles:

### 4.4.1 Micro-EDRR within Macro-Expand

The Macro-Expand phase is executed through a nested micro-EDRR:

- **Micro-Expand**: Broad exploration of potential solutions, approaches, and ideas. Agents generate diverse solution candidates, explore alternative approaches, and gather relevant context.
- **Micro-Differentiate**: Analysis and categorization of the expanded options. Agents compare approaches, evaluate options against requirements, and prioritize based on criteria.
- **Micro-Refine**: Improvement of selected approaches. Agents develop initial prototypes, draft data cleaning pipelines, and test initial prompt templates.
- **Micro-Retrospect**: Review of early exploration results. Agents analyze performance metrics, identify misalignments, and document lessons learned.


### 4.4.2 Micro-EDRR within Macro-Differentiate

The Macro-Differentiate phase is realized through its own internal micro-EDRR:

- **Micro-Expand**: Exploration of architectural patterns and model options. Agents survey software architecture patterns, LLM models, and analyze trade-offs.
- **Micro-Differentiate**: Selection of patterns and design of interfaces. Agents select optimal architectural patterns, design API specifications, and apply prompt engineering principles.
- **Micro-Refine**: Detailed design and proof-of-concept implementation. Agents generate detailed specifications, conduct small-scale proofs-of-concept, and generate unit tests.
- **Micro-Retrospect**: Architectural review and refinement. Agents review architectural decisions, evaluate trade-offs, and identify areas for improvement.


### 4.4.3 Micro-EDRR within Macro-Refine

The iterative Macro-Refine phase is manifested through its own internal micro-EDRR:

- **Micro-Expand**: Exploration of implementation approaches. Agents explore fine-tuning methodologies, prompt engineering strategies, and generate test cases.
- **Micro-Differentiate**: Selection of specific approaches and task decomposition. Agents select fine-tuning approaches, prioritize test cases, and decompose complex tasks.
- **Micro-Refine**: Core implementation loop. Agents write code, generate tests, apply optimizations, and debug errors in an iterative process.
- **Micro-Retrospect**: Iteration review and quality assessment. Agents assess code quality, evaluate fine-tuning effectiveness, and analyze debugging history.


### 4.4.4 Micro-EDRR within Macro-Retrospect

The continuous Macro-Retrospect phase is managed through its own iterative micro-EDRR:

- **Micro-Expand**: Exploration of development process improvements and best practices. Agents explore new development techniques, brainstorm quality indicators, and scan for potential process enhancements.
- **Micro-Differentiate**: Design of evaluation frameworks and formulation of guidelines. Agents design quality assessment frameworks, define development KPIs, and draft coding standards.
- **Micro-Refine**: Implementation of process improvements and guideline updates. Agents implement development workflows, refine feedback collection, and update coding standards.
- **Micro-Retrospect**: Meta-retrospective on development process effectiveness. Agents review the development workflow's effectiveness and the coding standards' adaptability.


### 4.4.5 Delimiting Principles for Recursion

To prevent unbounded recursion and ensure efficient operation, the following principles determine when EDRR recursion should end:

1. **Granularity Threshold**: Recursion ceases when the level of detail is sufficient for the current objective and further subdivision would be counterproductive.
2. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Recursion terminates when the marginal benefit of further iteration no longer justifies the computational cost.
3. **Quality Thresholds**: Recursion ends when predefined quality metrics (accuracy, performance, coverage) meet or exceed target thresholds.
4. **Resource Limits**: Hard limits on recursion depth, time, or computational resources prevent excessive iteration.
5. **Human Judgment**: Strategic human oversight provides the ultimate decision on when recursion should terminate, especially for subjective evaluations or high-stakes decisions.

## 6. Configuration Options

The EDRR behavior can be customized through configuration:

- **Stage Weights**: Adjust emphasis on different stages
- **Iteration Limits**: Set maximum iterations for refinement
- **Quality Thresholds**: Define acceptance criteria for outputs
- **Human Intervention Points**: Configure when human input is requested


## 7. Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the EDRR implementation:
