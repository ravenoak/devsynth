# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/enhance_retry_mechanism.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/enhance_retry_mechanism.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.


## Specification

## Acceptance Criteria

## Proofs

### Termination
Let \(r_0 = R\) be the maximum retry count. Each attempt updates the counter via \(r_{k+1} = r_k - 1\). After \(R\) attempts, \(r_R = 0\), so the process halts.

### Complexity
The time complexity grows linearly with the retry limit:

\[
T(R) = O(R)
\]

For exponential backoff with base \(b\), the cumulative wait time is

\[
W(R, b) = \sum_{i=0}^{R-1} b^i = \frac{b^{R} - 1}{b - 1}
\]

Simulation with \(R=3\) and \(b=2\) yields \(W=7\), matching the formula.
