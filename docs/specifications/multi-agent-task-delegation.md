# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/multi_agent_task_delegation.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/multi_agent_task_delegation.feature) and [`tests/behavior/features/general/delegate_task.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/delegate_task.feature) execute via [`tests/behavior/steps/test_delegate_task_steps.py`](../../tests/behavior/steps/test_delegate_task_steps.py), demonstrating collaborative processing, dialectical review, and consensus-based delegation results.
- Consensus-voting variants in [`tests/behavior/features/delegating_tasks_with_consensus_voting.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/delegating_tasks_with_consensus_voting.feature) and [`tests/behavior/features/general/delegate_task_consensus.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/delegate_task_consensus.feature) provide negative-path coverage for missing solutions and dialectical failures.
- Unit suites such as [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_delegate_task.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_delegate_task.py), [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_delegate_workflows.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_delegate_workflows.py), and [`tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_summary.py`](../../tests/unit/application/collaboration/test_wsde_team_consensus_summary.py) confirm delegation pipelines, contributor accounting, and consensus summaries.
- Integration runs in [`tests/integration/general/test_refactor_workflow.py`](../../tests/integration/general/test_refactor_workflow.py) route coordinator-driven delegation through the same APIs used in behavior tests.


## Specification

- The `WSDETeamCoordinator` exposes `delegate_task` to broadcast work to agents, collect solutions, and synthesize consensus results while returning contributor metadata.
- Dialectical reasoning precedes consensus when available, allowing critique and synthesis before a decision is finalized.
- Delegation records include contributors, chosen method, reasoning summaries, and any dialectical transcript for traceability.
- Error paths handle cases where no agent produces a solution or dialectical reasoning raises exceptions, returning structured error payloads.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Collaborative tasks record every participating agent, final consensus, and reasoning artifacts in both unit and behavior suites.
- Dialectical reasoning executes before consensus when configured, and failures produce meaningful error messages captured by the behavior tests.
- No-solution cases return explanatory payloads rather than raising unhandled exceptions.
