# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

DevSynth provides both CLI and WebUI interfaces for interactive development workflows. However, automation and integration scenarios require programmatic access to these capabilities. The Agent API fills this gap by providing REST endpoints that expose DevSynth's core functionality, enabling:

- Automated development pipelines
- Integration with external tools and services
- Remote access for distributed development teams
- API-first architecture for future extensibility

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/agent_api_interactions.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/agent_api_interactions.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.
- REST API design follows OpenAPI standards for discoverability and tooling integration.


## Specification

The Agent API provides HTTP endpoints that expose DevSynth's core workflows through a REST interface. The API mirrors CLI and WebUI functionality, allowing programmatic access to:

- Project initialization and configuration
- Code analysis and generation
- Testing and validation
- Requirements gathering and management
- Documentation synthesis
- Health monitoring and metrics

### API Endpoints

Core endpoints include:
- `POST /init` - Initialize new projects
- `POST /analyze` - Analyze code and repositories
- `POST /generate` - Generate code from specifications
- `POST /test` - Run tests and validation
- `POST /doctor` - Health checks and diagnostics
- `GET /health` - System health status
- `GET /metrics` - Performance and usage metrics

### Request/Response Format

All endpoints accept JSON requests and return structured responses with:
- `success`: Boolean indicating operation success
- `data`: Operation results or error details
- `messages`: User-facing progress and status messages
- `metadata`: Additional context and timing information

## Acceptance Criteria

- [X] All API endpoints respond with proper HTTP status codes
- [X] Request validation prevents malformed inputs
- [X] Error responses include actionable error messages
- [ ] Authentication and authorization mechanisms in place (planned for future release)
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse (planned for future release)
- [X] Response times meet performance requirements
- [X] All endpoints documented with OpenAPI specifications
