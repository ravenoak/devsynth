# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

Prevent releases from proceeding when the dialectical audit log contains unresolved questions.

## Specification

- Parse `dialectical_audit.log` for unresolved questions.
- Release verification fails with a non-zero exit code when unresolved questions are present.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Running `python scripts/verify_release_state.py` exits with status `1` when `dialectical_audit.log` lists unresolved questions.
- The script exits with status `0` when the log has no unresolved questions.
