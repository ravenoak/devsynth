# Link Requirement Changes to EDRR Outcomes

This specification ensures that every requirements update captured by the
requirements wizard or dialectical reasoning loop records an explicit
association with the Evaluation, Decision, Reflection, and Refinement (EDRR)
outcomes that follow. The linkage enables downstream audits to trace which
changes triggered new reasoning cycles, persisted results, and memory updates.

## Socratic Checklist

- **What is the problem?** Requirements changes were persisted without a
  consistent connection to the EDRR artifacts that recorded how the system
  reasoned about or acted on the change, weakening traceability for audits and
  WSDE peer review checkpoints.
- **What proofs confirm the solution?** Behavior-driven scenarios capture the
  requirement-to-outcome linkage, and unit tests exercise the persistence logic
  that writes structured relationship records into the memory subsystem.

## Specification

1. Persist a relationship record linking a requirement change identifier to the
   dialectical reasoning artifact generated during the EDRR cycle. The record
   must include the EDRR phase where the reasoning took place.
2. Persist an impact assessment document keyed by the same requirement change
   identifier and tagged with its EDRR phase.
3. Publish notifications that embed the requirement change identifier when
   impact assessments complete so orchestration layers can subscribe to the
   linkage.
4. Provide read APIs (or memory queries) capable of retrieving the reasoning
   and impact payloads for a requirement change alongside the originating EDRR
   phase.
5. Guard all persistence operations so a missing memory manager or storage
   failure is logged and does not crash the reasoning loop.

## Proof

- **Behavior-driven coverage** – The dialectical reasoning suites under
  [`tests/behavior/features/dialectical_reasoning/requirement_to_edrr_link.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/dialectical_reasoning/requirement_to_edrr_link.feature)
  and its general mirror verify that completing a reasoning pass records the
  change identifier with its EDRR outcomes and exposes the linkage to auditors.
- **Unit coverage** – The reasoning service stores relationship and document
  payloads for each change via the memory manager, exercised by
  [`tests/unit/application/requirements/test_dialectical_reasoner.py`](../../tests/unit/application/requirements/test_dialectical_reasoner.py).

## Acceptance Criteria

- Requirement changes captured through the dialectical reasoning workflow have
  associated reasoning and impact assessment entries in memory, tagged with the
  relevant EDRR phase.
- Behavior suites validate that the linkage exists and can be inspected by
  auditors.
- Unit tests cover the persistence helpers, including error handling when the
  memory manager is unavailable.
