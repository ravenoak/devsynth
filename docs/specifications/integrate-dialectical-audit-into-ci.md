Feature: Integrate dialectical audit into CI

# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- **What is the problem?** CI runs do not check the dialectical audit log, allowing
  undocumented or untested features to slip through.
- **What proofs confirm the solution?** A workflow step executes the dialectical
  audit script during CI and fails the build when unresolved questions exist.

## Motivation
Continuous integration currently ignores `dialectical_audit.log`, so
inconsistencies between documentation, tests, and code may go unnoticed. By
running the dialectical audit as part of CI, developers receive immediate
feedback whenever a feature lacks cross references, keeping the project in a
validated state.
## Specification
- Add a step to the CI workflow that executes `poetry run python
  scripts/dialectical_audit.py`.
- The step relies on the script's exit code; any unresolved questions cause the
  workflow to fail.
- The generated `dialectical_audit.log` is retained as a build artifact for
  inspection.
## Acceptance Criteria
- `ci.yml` includes a "Dialectical audit" step that runs the script above.
- A CI run fails when the audit reports unresolved questions.
- A CI run succeeds when the audit reports no questions and the log is
  available as an artifact.
