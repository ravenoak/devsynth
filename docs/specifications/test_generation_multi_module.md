# Multi-Module Test Generation Specification

## Problem
Existing test scaffolding creates placeholder tests in a single directory and
cannot organize generated tests for projects that contain multiple modules.

## Solution
Accept a list of module paths and scaffold a placeholder integration test within
an output directory for each module. Module paths using dot notation are
converted to nested folders. The resulting map of generated tests includes the
relative path to each file so callers can easily locate the scaffolds.

## Proof
Running the scaffolding on a project with modules `core` and `utils.parser`
produces `core/test_core.py` and `utils/parser/test_parser.py` which execute
successfully using `pytest`.

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- Pending BDD scenarios will verify termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.
