# Enhanced Knowledge Graph with Business Intent Layer

## 1. Overview

This specification defines the enhancement of DevSynth's existing knowledge graph to include a business intent layer that bridges the "Meaning Barrier" identified in the inspirational research documents. The enhancement transforms the current code-focused graph into a comprehensive knowledge representation that connects business requirements, design decisions, implementation, and validation.

## 2. Purpose and Goals

The enhanced knowledge graph aims to:

1. **Break the Meaning Barrier**: Connect code "what" with business "why" through semantic linking
2. **Enable Complete Traceability**: Support end-to-end traceability from business requirements to implementation
3. **Enhance AI Reasoning**: Provide rich context for LLM reasoning that includes business intent
4. **Support Impact Analysis**: Enable accurate assessment of change impacts across business and technical layers
5. **Facilitate Requirements Validation**: Ensure implementation aligns with business needs

## 3. Core Problem Statement

Research demonstrates that current LLM code comprehension systems understand "what" code does but fail to understand "why" it exists or what business requirements it fulfills. This "Meaning Barrier" results in:
- 81% failure rate on semantically equivalent code with different variable names
- Inability to connect implementation to business value
- Limited impact analysis capabilities
- Poor requirement-to-implementation traceability

```

## 6. Integration with DevSynth Components

### 6.1 EDRR Integration

Enhanced knowledge graph provides context for each EDRR phase:

```python
class EnhancedEDRRIntegration:
    """Integration of enhanced knowledge graph with EDRR framework."""

    def enhance_expand_phase(self, query: str, graph: EnhancedKnowledgeGraph) -> ExpandedContext:
        """Enhance expand phase with business intent awareness."""
        # Find related business requirements
        business_context = graph.query_business_context(query)

        # Find implementation patterns
        technical_patterns = graph.query_technical_patterns(query)

        # Combine for comprehensive expansion
        return ExpandedContext(
            business_context=business_context,
            technical_patterns=technical_patterns,
            intent_links=graph.get_intent_links(query)
        )

    def enhance_differentiate_phase(self, alternatives: List[Solution], graph: EnhancedKnowledgeGraph) -> DifferentiatedAnalysis:
        """Enhance differentiate phase with impact analysis."""
        analyses = []

        for alternative in alternatives:
            # Calculate business impact
            business_impact = self._calculate_business_impact(alternative, graph)

            # Assess technical feasibility
            technical_feasibility = self._assess_technical_feasibility(alternative, graph)

            # Evaluate requirement satisfaction
            requirement_satisfaction = self._evaluate_requirement_satisfaction(alternative, graph)

            analyses.append(SolutionAnalysis(
                solution=alternative,
                business_impact=business_impact,
                technical_feasibility=technical_feasibility,
                requirement_satisfaction=requirement_satisfaction
            ))

        return DifferentiatedAnalysis(analyses=analyses)
```

### 6.2 Memory System Integration

Enhanced graph integrates with existing hybrid memory:

```python
class EnhancedMemoryIntegration:
    """Integration between enhanced knowledge graph and memory systems."""

    def store_enhanced_entities(self, entities: List[Entity], memory_manager) -> None:
        """Store enhanced entities across memory backends."""
        # Store in graph store for relationship queries
        self._store_in_graph_backend(entities, memory_manager.graph_store)

        # Store in vector store for semantic search
        self._store_in_vector_backend(entities, memory_manager.vector_store)

        # Store in document store for detailed context
        self._store_in_document_backend(entities, memory_manager.document_store)

    def query_enhanced_context(self, query: str, memory_manager) -> EnhancedContext:
        """Query enhanced context across all memory backends."""
        # Graph traversal for structural relationships
        graph_results = memory_manager.graph_store.query_business_context(query)

        # Vector similarity for semantic matches
        vector_results = memory_manager.vector_store.query_semantic_similarity(query)

        # Document retrieval for detailed explanations
        document_results = memory_manager.document_store.query_detailed_context(query)

        return EnhancedContext(
            graph_context=graph_results,
            semantic_context=vector_results,
            document_context=document_results
        )
```

## 7. Implementation Details

### 7.1 Graph Database Selection

Choose appropriate backend based on enhanced requirements:

```python
class EnhancedGraphBackendSelection:
    """Select optimal graph backend for enhanced knowledge graph."""

    def select_backend(self, project_scale: ProjectScale) -> GraphBackend:
        """Select appropriate backend based on project requirements."""
        if project_scale == ProjectScale.LARGE:
            return Neo4jBackend(
                uri="bolt://localhost:7687",
                auth=("neo4j", "password"),
                database="devsynth_enhanced"
            )
        elif project_scale == ProjectScale.MEDIUM:
            return NebulaGraphBackend(
                metad_config=nebula_config,
                graph_spaces=["devsynth_knowledge"]
            )
        else:  # SMALL
            return RDFLibBackend(
                store="Memory",
                format="turtle"
            )
```

### 7.2 Performance Optimization

```python
class EnhancedGraphOptimizer:
    """Performance optimization for enhanced knowledge graph."""

    def optimize_intent_queries(self, graph: EnhancedKnowledgeGraph) -> OptimizedGraph:
        """Optimize graph structure for intent-based queries."""
        # Create intent-specific indexes
        intent_indexes = self._create_intent_indexes(graph)

        # Optimize relationship traversal
        traversal_optimization = self._optimize_relationship_traversal(graph)

        # Cache frequently accessed intent patterns
        pattern_cache = self._build_pattern_cache(graph)

        return OptimizedGraph(
            graph=graph,
            intent_indexes=intent_indexes,
            traversal_optimization=traversal_optimization,
            pattern_cache=pattern_cache
        )

    def _create_intent_indexes(self, graph: EnhancedKnowledgeGraph) -> IntentIndexes:
        """Create indexes for efficient intent-based queries."""
        # Index by business requirement priority
        requirement_index = self._index_by_requirement_priority(graph)

        # Index by business impact
        impact_index = self._index_by_business_impact(graph)

        # Index by semantic similarity clusters
        similarity_index = self._index_by_semantic_clusters(graph)

        return IntentIndexes(
            requirement_priority=requirement_index,
            business_impact=impact_index,
            semantic_clusters=similarity_index
        )

## 9. Testing Strategy

### 9.1 Intent Discovery Testing

```gherkin
Feature: Enhanced Knowledge Graph Intent Discovery
  As a DevSynth developer
  I want the knowledge graph to discover business intent behind code
  So that AI agents can understand why code exists, not just what it does

  Background:
    Given the enhanced knowledge graph is configured with intent discovery
    And business requirements are loaded into the graph
    And code is analyzed and stored in the graph
    And intent linking is enabled

  @intent_discovery @business_context @high_priority
  Scenario: Discover business intent from function names and comments
    Given I have a function named "calculate_user_monthly_revenue"
    And the function has comments about "monthly recurring revenue calculation"
    And there is a business requirement for "revenue tracking and reporting"
    When the intent discovery engine analyzes the function
    Then it should link the function to the revenue tracking requirement
    And assign a confidence score > 0.8
    And provide evidence of the semantic connection
    And validate the link against acceptance criteria

  @semantic_linking @meaning_barrier @critical
  Scenario: Bridge meaning barrier with semantic linking
    Given code comments contain business intent descriptions
    And requirements describe business needs and value
    When the semantic linking engine processes the artifacts
    Then it should create links between code and requirements with >80% accuracy
    And identify intent-implementation alignment issues
    And suggest improvements for unclear code intent
    And maintain semantic links during code evolution

  @impact_analysis @blast_radius @medium_priority
  Scenario: Calculate business impact of technical changes
    Given a proposed change to a core authentication function
    And the function implements multiple business requirements
    And affects several user journeys
    When I query the impact of the proposed change
    Then the system should identify all affected business requirements
    And calculate the business value impact
    And assess risk to user experience
    And suggest mitigation strategies
    And provide confidence metrics for the analysis
```

## 10. Migration Strategy

### 10.1 Backward Compatibility

- Existing knowledge graph queries continue to work unchanged
- Enhanced features are opt-in via configuration
- Gradual migration path from current simple graph

### 10.2 Data Migration

1. **Phase 1**: Analyze existing graph structure and entities
2. **Phase 2**: Map current entities to enhanced schema
3. **Phase 3**: Add business intent layer alongside existing structure
4. **Phase 4**: Validate enhanced graph maintains all existing functionality
5. **Phase 5**: Enable enhanced features for new projects

## 11. Requirements

- **EKG-001**: Enhanced knowledge graph must support business intent discovery with >80% accuracy
- **EKG-002**: Intent-to-implementation linking must achieve >75% semantic similarity accuracy
- **EKG-003**: Multi-hop queries must traverse business and technical layers seamlessly
- **EKG-004**: Integration must maintain backward compatibility with existing graph operations
- **EKG-005**: Performance impact must be <15% compared to current system

## Implementation Status

This specification defines the **planned** enhanced knowledge graph with business intent layer. Implementation will proceed in phases as outlined in the migration strategy.
