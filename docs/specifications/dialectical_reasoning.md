# Dialectical Reasoner Evaluation Hooks

## Problem

External collaborators lacked a deterministic way to observe requirement evaluations, making it difficult to audit consensus decisions.

## Solution

The dialectical reasoner exposes evaluation hooks. Registered callbacks receive the ``DialecticalReasoning`` instance and a boolean indicating whether consensus was reached. Hooks execute after every evaluation, even when consensus fails. Exceptions raised by hooks are logged and suppressed so the evaluation workflow continues.

## Verification

- Unit test: a hook receives the reasoning and consensus flag when evaluation succeeds.
- Unit test: hook exceptions are logged without interrupting evaluation.
- Unit test: a hook runs when consensus is not reached and receives ``False``.

## Termination
### Termination Proof

Let ``H`` denote the list of registered evaluation hooks and ``n = |H|``.  The
hook execution algorithm is equivalent to the loop::

    for i in range(n):
        H[i](reasoning, consensus)

Define a variant ``v(i) = n - i`` over the natural numbers.  At the start of the
loop ``v(0) = n`` and ``v`` decreases by one on each iteration.  Because ``v`` is
non-negative and strictly decreases, the loop is well founded and must terminate
when ``v(i) = 0`` after exactly ``n`` iterations.  Hooks are prevented from
registering additional hooks while the loop runs, so ``n`` remains constant
throughout execution.

### Complexity Analysis

Let ``T_i`` bound the cost of the ``i``\ th hook.  The loop performs ``n``
iterations and invokes each hook once, yielding total time ``Î˜(n + \sum T_i)``.
When every hook runs in constant time ``T``, the evaluation adds ``O(n)``
overhead.  The algorithm uses ``O(1)`` additional space beyond the storage for
the hook list.

### Simulation

The snippet below demonstrates termination and linear scaling even for a large
number of hooks::

    for _ in range(1000):
        service.register_evaluation_hook(lambda r, c: None)
    service.evaluate_change(change)  # completes in O(n)

Unit tests under
``tests/unit/methodology/test_dialectical_reasoner_termination.py`` and
``tests/behavior/test_dialectical_reasoner_termination_behavior.py`` exercise
these edge cases to confirm termination and complexity bounds.

For a formal convergence argument, see the analysis in
``docs/analysis/dialectical_reasoning_loop_convergence.md``.
