# Dialectical Reasoner Evaluation Hooks

## Problem

External collaborators lacked a deterministic way to observe requirement evaluations, making it difficult to audit consensus decisions.

## Solution

The dialectical reasoner exposes evaluation hooks. Registered callbacks receive the ``DialecticalReasoning`` instance and a boolean indicating whether consensus was reached. Hooks execute after every evaluation, even when consensus fails. Exceptions raised by hooks are logged and suppressed so the evaluation workflow continues.

## Verification

- Unit test: a hook receives the reasoning and consensus flag when evaluation succeeds.
- Unit test: hook exceptions are logged without interrupting evaluation.
- Unit test: a hook runs when consensus is not reached and receives ``False``.

## Termination

Let ``n`` be the number of registered evaluation hooks. After producing a
``DialecticalReasoning`` result, the service iterates through this finite set of
hooks exactly once. If ``T_i`` bounds the execution time of the ``i``\ th hook,
then the total additional work is ``\sum_{i=1}^n T_i``. Because ``n`` is finite
and hooks cannot register new hooks during iteration, the evaluation loop is
guaranteed to terminate.

### Simulation

The snippet below demonstrates termination even for a large number of hooks::

    for _ in range(1000):
        service.register_evaluation_hook(lambda r, c: None)
    service.evaluate_change(change)  # completes in O(n)

Unit tests under
``tests/unit/methodology/test_dialectical_reasoner_termination.py`` exercise
these edge cases to confirm termination.
