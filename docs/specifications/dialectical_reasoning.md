# Dialectical Reasoner Evaluation Hooks

## Problem

External collaborators lacked a deterministic way to observe requirement evaluations, making it difficult to audit consensus decisions.

## Solution

The dialectical reasoner exposes evaluation hooks. Registered callbacks receive the ``DialecticalReasoning`` instance and a boolean indicating whether consensus was reached. Hooks execute after every evaluation, even when consensus fails. Exceptions raised by hooks are logged and suppressed so the evaluation workflow continues.

## Verification

- Unit test: a hook receives the reasoning and consensus flag when evaluation succeeds.
- Unit test: hook exceptions are logged without interrupting evaluation.
- Unit test: a hook runs when consensus is not reached and receives ``False``.
