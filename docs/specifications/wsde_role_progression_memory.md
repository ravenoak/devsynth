# WSDE Role Progression and Memory Semantics

## Problem

WSDE agents rotate roles across EDRR phases, yet role assignments were exposed
by name rather than by durable identifiers. In addition, memory updates queued
during collaboration could remain unflushed when phase transitions occurred,
leading to inconsistent shared state.

## Proof

- `WSDETeam.add_agent` assigns a stable `id` when absent.
- `WSDE.get_role_assignments` returns a mapping of agent `id` to current role.
- `devsynth.domain.wsde.workflow.progress_roles` assigns roles for a given
  phase and flushes queued memory updates.
- `collaboration_memory_utils.flush_memory_queue` clears the sync queue after a
  flush attempt.

## Requirements

1. Role assignments MUST be keyed by agent identifier.
2. Progressing to a new EDRR phase MUST invoke `progress_roles` which also
   flushes queued memory operations.
3. Memory flush operations MUST return flushed items and leave the queue empty
   for subsequent updates.

## Out of Scope

- Selection heuristics for role assignment.
- Long-term persistence of flushed memory items.

- `tests/behavior/features/wsde/collaboration_flow.feature`

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/wsde_role_progression_memory.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/wsde_role_progression_memory.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.
