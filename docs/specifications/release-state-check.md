# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

Ensure release documentation marked as published has a corresponding Git tag.

## Specification

- Parse `docs/release/0.1.0-alpha.1.md` to read its `status` and `version`.
- When `status` is `published`, verify a tag matching `v<version>` exists.
- Fail with a non-zero exit code when the tag is missing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Running `python scripts/verify_release_state.py` exits with status `1` when the release is marked as published and tag `v0.1.0-alpha.1` does not exist.
- The script exits with status `0` otherwise.
