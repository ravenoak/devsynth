# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?

- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/interactive_requirements_flow_cli.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/interactive_requirements_flow_cli.feature) and [`tests/behavior/features/general/interactive_flow_cli.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/general/interactive_flow_cli.feature) verify the CLI collector prompts, confirms, and writes structured output.
- Unit coverage in [`tests/unit/application/requirements/test_interactions.py`](../../tests/unit/application/requirements/test_interactions.py) exercises the success path and cancellation handling for `RequirementsCollector`.
- End-to-end orchestration is mirrored by [`tests/behavior/steps/test_interactive_flow_steps.py`](../../tests/behavior/steps/test_interactive_flow_steps.py), which binds the collector to the UX bridge abstraction.

## Intended Behaviors

- **Prompt-driven collection** – The CLI collector asks for name, language, and features via `UXBridge` and refuses to persist if the user declines confirmation. Covered by [`tests/behavior/features/interactive_requirements_flow_cli.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/interactive_requirements_flow_cli.feature).
- **Structured persistence** – On confirmation the collector normalizes comma- or semicolon-separated feature inputs and writes `interactive_requirements.json`. Verified by [`tests/unit/application/requirements/test_interactions.py`](../../tests/unit/application/requirements/test_interactions.py).
- **User feedback** – The collector surfaces "Requirements saved" or "Cancelled" messages through the bridge, ensuring scripts can assert outcomes. Exercised in [`tests/unit/application/requirements/test_interactions.py`](../../tests/unit/application/requirements/test_interactions.py).


## Specification

## Acceptance Criteria

- Confirming the flow writes `interactive_requirements.json` with normalized feature lists and displays "Requirements saved".
- Declining confirmation leaves no output file and surfaces "Cancelled".
- The collector returns control without raising when the bridge answers `back` before confirmation, enabling scripted retries.
