# Summary

Defines the process for ingesting project documentation into DevSynth's knowledge base.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/project_documentation_ingestion.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/project_documentation_ingestion.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.


Project documentation is scattered across the repository, making it difficult to index and retrieve consistently. A dedicated ingestion process ensures documentation is discoverable and structured for downstream tasks.

## Specification

- Scan the `docs/` tree for Markdown files containing YAML front matter.
- Extract title, tags, and relative path from each document.
- Exclude directories such as `docs/inspirational_docs/` from ingestion.
- Produce an index that maps document metadata to file paths for retrieval.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Documents with valid front matter are recorded in the index with title, tags, and path.
- Ingestion skips excluded directories and non-Markdown files.
- The generated index is accessible for retrieval by other components.
