# Generated Test Execution Failure

## Summary
Scaffolded tests execute and fail when underlying requirements are unimplemented.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/generated_test_execution_failure.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/generated_test_execution_failure.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.

Developers need immediate feedback when requirements are unmet, so scaffolded tests should fail until implemented.

## Specification
- Placeholder tests produced by `devsynth.testing.generation.scaffold_integration_tests` omit skip markers.
- Running the generated tests raises `NotImplementedError` until real tests replace them.
- `TestAgent` exposes `run_generated_tests` to execute tests in a directory and surface failures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Generated placeholder tests fail when executed.
- `TestAgent.run_generated_tests` raises `DevSynthError` if test execution succeeds unexpectedly.
