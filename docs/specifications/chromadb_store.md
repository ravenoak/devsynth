# Summary

The ChromaDB memory store integrates the ChromaDB vector database to persist and
retrieve memory items with embedding-based search. It provides insight into
optimization status and storage efficiency for embeddings.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

DevSynth requires a memory store that supports vector-based queries while
tracking how efficiently embeddings are stored. Developers need a simple way to
confirm that the store optimizes embeddings and to inspect the efficiency
metric.

## Specification

- The `ChromaDBStore` exposes `has_optimized_embeddings()` to indicate whether
  embedding optimization is active.
- The `ChromaDBStore` exposes `get_embedding_storage_efficiency()` returning a
  float between 0 and 1 representing how effectively embeddings are stored.

## Requirements

- **CDS-001**: The ChromaDB store must import successfully when the `chromadb`
  extras are installed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A ChromaDB memory store reports optimized embeddings when
  `has_optimized_embeddings()` is called.
- `get_embedding_storage_efficiency()` returns a value greater than `0` and not
  greater than `1`.
