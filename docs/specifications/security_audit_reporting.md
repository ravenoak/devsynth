title: Security Audit Reporting Specification
version: '0.1.0a1'
---

# Summary

DevSynth should produce a structured report summarizing security audit checks.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/security_audit_reporting.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/security_audit_reporting.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.


Security audits currently run Bandit and Safety but do not emit a consolidated report.
Providing a machine-readable summary helps developers and CI pipelines verify compliance.

## Specification

- The `security-audit` command accepts a `--report <path>` option.
- The command validates pre-deployment checks and mandatory security flags.
- When audits run, the command records the result of Bandit and Safety checks.
- Results are written as JSON with keys for each check and values of `passed`, `failed`, or `skipped`.
- The command exits with a non-zero status if any required check fails.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Running `security-audit --report audit.json` writes a JSON file containing
  `bandit` and `safety` result fields.
- Failing a check sets the corresponding field to `failed` and the process exits
  with a non-zero status.
