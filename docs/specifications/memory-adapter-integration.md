# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
  The memory adapter currently lacks a formally documented proof that its
  transaction lifecycle is correct across begin, commit, and rollback states.
- What proofs confirm the solution?
  A correctness proof is documented below and validated through a randomized
  simulation script plus unit tests exercising failure scenarios.

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/memory_adapter_integration.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/memory_adapter_integration.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.


Establishing and validating transaction invariants ensures that adapters can
compose safely and that rollback semantics protect the persistent state.

## Specification

### Transaction Lifecycle

1. `begin_transaction` captures a snapshot of the current memory state and returns a unique transaction identifier.
2. Mutating operations (`store`, `delete`, `update`) applied while the transaction is active operate on a working set derived from the snapshot.
3. `commit_transaction` replaces the persistent state with the working set and discards the snapshot.
4. `rollback_transaction` restores the snapshot and discards the working set.
5. After `commit_transaction` or `rollback_transaction` the transaction is inactive and further calls with the same identifier fail.

### Correctness Proof

Let `S₀` denote the memory state when `begin_transaction` is invoked and `S_w` the working state after applying a finite sequence of operations.

*Invariant 1 – snapshot safety*: `S₀` is preserved until either `commit_transaction` or `rollback_transaction` is executed.

*Invariant 2 – commit*: If `commit_transaction(tx)` succeeds, the resulting state `S_f` equals `S_w` and the transaction `tx` is no longer active.

*Invariant 3 – rollback*: If `rollback_transaction(tx)` succeeds, the resulting state `S_f` equals `S₀` and the transaction `tx` is no longer active.

From the invariants it follows that every operation sequence within a transaction either:

* persists exactly once when committed, or
* has no effect when rolled back.

This establishes atomicity of the transaction lifecycle.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Documentation explains transactional invariants and provides the above correctness proof.
- A simulation script under `scripts/` validates the invariants through randomized operations.
- Unit tests under `tests/unit/memory/` cover failure scenarios and ensure invariants hold.
