# UXBridge Interface Extension

This document defines the extended interaction methods that allow DevSynth's
workflow logic to remain UI agnostic. The updated API introduces more
descriptive names so that new frontâ€‘ends like the WebUI and Agent API can reuse
the same workflows without modification.

## Requirements

1. **ask_question(message, choices=None, default=None, show_default=True)**
   - Present a question to the user and return their response.
   - Optionally provide a list of choices and a default value.
2. **confirm_choice(message, default=False)**
   - Ask the user to confirm an action and return ``True`` or ``False``.
3. **display_result(message, highlight=False)**
   - Output a message to the user. When ``highlight`` is ``True`` the
     implementation may emphasize the text.
4. Legacy methods ``prompt``, ``confirm`` and ``print`` must remain as aliases
   for backward compatibility.
5. Implementations MUST avoid direct ``input()`` or ``print()`` calls and use
   the bridge instead so that workflows behave consistently across interfaces.

## Rationale

The original bridge exposed minimal methods which tightly coupled the CLI to the
workflow code. As additional interfaces were introduced it became necessary to
abstract user interactions behind a stable API. These methods map cleanly to
both textual and graphical UIs and allow tests to mock the interface easily.
