# RAG+ Integration Specification

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem? DevSynth's current retrieval lacks application-aware reasoning, limiting complex multi-step tasks
- What proofs confirm the solution? RAG+ dual corpus architecture with knowledge and application examples enhances reasoning performance in mathematical, legal, and technical domains

## Motivation

DevSynth's hybrid memory system includes vector stores for semantic retrieval, but lacks the sophisticated reasoning-aware retrieval techniques described in the RAG+ framework. The document "Contextual Equilibrium" demonstrates that standard RAG systems struggle with the cognitive gap between retrieving factual knowledge and understanding how to apply that knowledge in structured reasoning processes.

RAG+ addresses this by maintaining a dual corpus architecture that provides both declarative ("what") and procedural ("how-to") guidance, enabling LLMs to perform complex reasoning tasks more effectively.

## Specification

### Dual Corpus Architecture

#### Knowledge Corpus
- **Purpose**: Store declarative facts and domain knowledge
- **Content Types**: Technical documentation, API references, factual information
- **Indexing**: Semantic embeddings for retrieval based on conceptual similarity
- **Structure**: Hierarchical organization by domain and topic

#### Application Examples Corpus
- **Purpose**: Store procedural guidance and worked-out examples
- **Content Types**: Step-by-step reasoning chains, solved problems, workflow examples
- **Indexing**: Combined semantic and structural embeddings
- **Structure**: Organized by problem type, complexity level, and application domain

### Joint Retrieval Mechanism

#### Query Processing
- **Query Rewriting**: Transform user queries into effective retrieval prompts
- **Query Decomposition**: Break complex questions into sub-questions for parallel retrieval
- **Multi-Modal Enhancement**: Support text, code, and structural query patterns

#### Dual Retrieval Pipeline
1. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Retrieve relevant factual information
2. **Application Retrieval**: Retrieve corresponding procedural examples
3. **Relevance Scoring**: Cross-correlate knowledge and application relevance
4. **Result Fusion**: Combine and rank knowledge-example pairs

### Reasoning Enhancement Features

#### Application-Aware Retrieval
- **Procedural Guidance**: Provide step-by-step examples alongside factual information
- **Cognitive Scaffolding**: Support multi-hop reasoning with worked examples
- **Domain Adaptation**: Specialized retrieval for mathematics, law, medicine, and software engineering

#### Quality Assurance
- **Factual Accuracy**: Validate retrieved information against trusted sources
- **Example Relevance**: Ensure application examples match query context
- **Bias Detection**: Monitor for retrieval bias in application examples

### Integration with DevSynth Architecture

#### Memory System Integration
- **Vector Store Enhancement**: Extend ChromaDB with dual corpus indexing
- **Graph Store Reasoning**: Use RDFLib for representing example relationships
- **Structured Store Metadata**: Track example provenance and quality metrics

#### Agent Workflow Integration
- **EDRR Phase Support**: Provide reasoning examples during Differentiate and Refine phases
- **WSDE Collaboration**: Share application examples across agent roles
- **Context Engineering**: Use retrieved examples in hierarchical context stacks

### Performance Optimization

#### Retrieval Efficiency
- **Caching Strategies**: Cache frequently accessed knowledge-example pairs
- **Batch Processing**: Optimize retrieval for multiple related queries
- **Incremental Indexing**: Support real-time addition of new examples

#### Quality Metrics
- **Retrieval Precision**: Measure accuracy of knowledge-example matching
- **Reasoning Improvement**: Track enhancement in task completion quality
- **Latency Monitoring**: Ensure retrieval doesn't bottleneck agent performance

## Acceptance Criteria

- Dual corpus stores knowledge and application examples with proper indexing
- Joint retrieval returns both factual information and procedural examples
- Query decomposition handles complex multi-part questions
- Reasoning performance improves by >20% on benchmark tasks
- Integration maintains existing retrieval performance for simple queries
