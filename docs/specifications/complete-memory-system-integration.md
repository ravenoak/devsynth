# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
  - Memory backends operate independently, causing inconsistent persistence and retrieval.
- What proofs confirm the solution?
  - Integration tests demonstrate successful registration, transfer, and synchronization across stores.

## Motivation
Agents need a unified interface to work with heterogeneous memory stores.
`MemoryIntegrationManager` provides registration, synchronization, and volatility controls,
enabling stable cross-store operations.
## Specification
### MemoryIntegrationManager

- Register named memory and vector stores.
- Transfer items between stores while preserving metadata.
- Synchronize stores optionally in both directions.
- Query across selected stores and aggregate results.
- Apply memory volatility controls when supported.
## Acceptance Criteria
- Multiple memory stores can be registered and synchronized.
- Items transferred between stores retain metadata.
- Cross-store queries return results grouped by store.
- Volatility controls report volatile item identifiers.
