# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
  The memory subsystem supports several backends but lacks a unified
  integration layer and graceful handling of optional dependencies.
- What proofs confirm the solution?
  Integration tests and adapter initialization logs demonstrate stable
  operation across FAISS, LMDB, and Kuzu backends.

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/complete_memory_system_integration.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/complete_memory_system_integration.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.


Reliable persistence and retrieval are core to DevSynth's agent workflow.
Without a cohesive memory layer, agents encounter inconsistent behavior
and fragile error handling when optional stores are missing.

## Specification

- Finalize synchronization manager supporting LMDB, FAISS, and Kuzu stores.
- Harden ChromaDB adapter and transactional semantics.
- Expand integration tests covering persistence and retrieval paths.
- Ensure missing LMDB dependencies raise clear, actionable errors.

### Transaction semantics

The synchronization manager coordinates TinyDB, DuckDB, LMDB, and Kuzu
stores using snapshot-based transactions. Before mutating any store the
manager records its state; on successful completion changes are committed
across all adapters, while any exception triggers a rollback restoring the
snapshots.

### Failure modes

- Construction fails with a descriptive error if any required adapter is
  absent.
- During a transaction, an exception from one store causes all stores to
  revert to their pre-transaction state preventing partial writes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- MemorySystemAdapter initializes any configured store or fails with a
  descriptive error.
- Integration tests demonstrate read/write operations across all
  supported backends.
- Optional dependencies can be absent without crashing the application.
