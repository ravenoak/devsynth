# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
  The memory subsystem supports several backends but lacks a unified
  integration layer and graceful handling of optional dependencies.
- What proofs confirm the solution?
  Integration tests and adapter initialization logs demonstrate stable
  operation across FAISS, LMDB, and Kuzu backends.

## Motivation

Reliable persistence and retrieval are core to DevSynth's agent workflow.
Without a cohesive memory layer, agents encounter inconsistent behavior
and fragile error handling when optional stores are missing.

## Specification

- Finalize synchronization manager supporting TinyDB, DuckDB, LMDB, and Kuzu stores.
- Harden transactional semantics across adapters.
- Expand integration tests covering persistence and retrieval paths.
- Ensure missing LMDB dependencies raise clear, actionable errors.

## Transaction Semantics

- Synchronization manager performs write-through updates to all configured stores.
- Writes occur sequentially; failures halt propagation and surface the error.
- Retrieval queries fall back through stores in declaration order.

## Failure Modes

- Absence of an optional store dependency logs a warning but does not block others.
- Write failures leave previously updated stores committed and later stores untouched.
- Invoking synchronization with a store lacking `get_all_items` results in a no-op.

## Acceptance Criteria

- MemorySystemAdapter initializes any configured store or fails with a
  descriptive error.
- Integration tests demonstrate read/write operations across all
  supported backends.
- Optional dependencies can be absent without crashing the application.
