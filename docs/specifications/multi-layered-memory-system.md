# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
 - What is the problem?
   Inefficient memory organization slows retrieval and mixes short-term data
   with long-term knowledge.
 - What proofs confirm the solution?
   Unit tests, BDD scenarios and property-based tests exercising the tiered
   cache verify correctness and eviction behaviour.

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/multi_layered_memory_system.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/multi_layered_memory_system.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.

Organize agent knowledge so frequently accessed items remain fast while less
used data persists in cheaper layers.

## Specification
- Memory is split into short-term, episodic and semantic layers determined by
  `MemoryType`.
- `store` places items in the correct layer and returns an identifier.
- `retrieve` fetches by identifier and optionally caches the result.
- The tiered cache uses an LRU policy and reports hit/miss statistics via
  `get_cache_stats`.
- Cache size is bounded by `max_size` and can be cleared or disabled at runtime.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Storing items with types `CONTEXT`, `TASK_HISTORY` and `KNOWLEDGE` persists
  them to short-term, episodic and semantic layers respectively.
- **HMA-003**: When the tiered cache is enabled, a second retrieval of the same
  identifier increments cache hit counters.
- **HMA-004**: Cache size never exceeds the configured maximum.
- BDD feature `tests/behavior/features/general/multi_layered_memory_system.feature`
  and property tests in `tests/property/test_tiered_cache_properties.py` pass.
