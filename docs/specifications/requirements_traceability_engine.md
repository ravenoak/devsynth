# Requirements Traceability Engine

## 1. Introduction

This specification defines the requirements traceability engine that provides automated verification and validation of requirements traceability throughout the development lifecycle. The system ensures that all requirements are properly linked to specifications, implementation, and tests.

## 2. System Overview

The requirements traceability engine provides:

1. **Automated traceability verification** of requirements to implementation
2. **Cross-reference validation** between specifications, code, and tests
3. **BDD feature verification** ensuring features are properly referenced
4. **Traceability gap analysis** identifying missing links and coverage
5. **Traceability reporting** with comprehensive traceability matrices

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1 Traceability Verification Engine

The traceability verification engine validates requirement links:

```python
class TraceabilityVerificationEngine:
    """Verifies requirements traceability throughout the system."""

    def verify_requirements_matrix(
        self,
        matrix_path: Path,
        spec_dir: Path,
        code_dir: Path,
        test_dir: Path
    ) -> TraceabilityReport:
        """Verify complete requirements traceability."""
        # Validate requirement references
        # Check specification links
        # Verify code implementation
        # Validate test coverage
        pass

    def verify_specification_links(self, spec_path: Path) -> List[LinkError]:
        """Verify specification contains proper requirement links."""
        pass

    def verify_bdd_feature_references(self, spec_path: Path) -> List[FeatureError]:
        """Verify BDD feature files are properly referenced."""
        pass

    def verify_code_implementation(self, requirement_id: str) -> List[ImplementationError]:
        """Verify code implements the specified requirement."""
        pass
```

### 3.2 Cross-Reference Validator

The cross-reference validator ensures consistency across all artifacts:

```python
class CrossReferenceValidator:
    """Validates cross-references between all system artifacts."""

    def validate_specification_references(self) -> List[ReferenceError]:
        """Validate all references in specifications."""
        pass

    def validate_code_references(self) -> List[ReferenceError]:
        """Validate all references in code comments."""
        pass

    def validate_test_references(self) -> List[ReferenceError]:
        """Validate all references in test files."""
        pass

    def generate_consistency_report(self) -> ConsistencyReport:
        """Generate consistency report across all artifacts."""
        pass
```

### 3.3 Traceability Gap Analyzer

The gap analyzer identifies missing links and coverage issues:

```python
class TraceabilityGapAnalyzer:
    """Analyzes gaps in requirements traceability."""

    def analyze_traceability_gaps(self) -> List[TraceabilityGap]:
        """Analyze gaps in requirements traceability."""
        pass

    def identify_missing_implementation(self) -> List[MissingImplementation]:
        """Identify requirements without implementation."""
        pass

    def identify_missing_tests(self) -> List[MissingTest]:
        """Identify requirements without tests."""
        pass

    def identify_missing_documentation(self) -> List[MissingDocumentation]:
        """Identify requirements without documentation."""
        pass

    def prioritize_gaps(self) -> List[PrioritizedGap]:
        """Prioritize gaps by impact and effort."""
        pass
```

### 3.4 Traceability Report Generator

The report generator creates comprehensive traceability matrices:

```python
class TraceabilityReportGenerator:
    """Generates comprehensive traceability reports."""

    def generate_traceability_matrix(
        self,
        format: str = "html"
    ) -> str:
        """Generate requirements traceability matrix."""
        pass

    def generate_coverage_report(self) -> CoverageReport:
        """Generate traceability coverage report."""
        pass

    def generate_gap_analysis_report(self) -> GapAnalysisReport:
        """Generate traceability gap analysis report."""
        pass

    def generate_compliance_report(self) -> ComplianceReport:
        """Generate compliance report for traceability."""
        pass
```

## 4. Integration Points

### 4.1 Agent System Integration

Traceability verification capabilities are available as agent tools:

```python
# Agent tools for requirements traceability
class TraceabilityTools:
    """Tools for agents to verify requirements traceability."""

    def verify_requirement_links(self, requirement_id: str) -> TraceabilityReport:
        """Verify links for a specific requirement."""
        pass

    def analyze_traceability_gaps(self) -> GapAnalysisReport:
        """Analyze gaps in requirements traceability."""
        pass

    def suggest_traceability_improvements(self) -> List[TraceabilitySuggestion]:
        """Suggest improvements to traceability."""
        pass

    def generate_traceability_report(self, scope: str) -> Report:
        """Generate traceability report for specified scope."""
        pass
```

### 4.2 EDRR Methodology Integration

Traceability verification integrates with the EDRR methodology:

- **Expand Phase**: Identify traceability requirements and coverage gaps
- **Differentiate Phase**: Compare different traceability approaches and select optimal strategies
- **Refine Phase**: Implement selected traceability improvements with comprehensive validation
- **Retrospect Phase**: Analyze traceability effectiveness and identify improvement opportunities

### 4.3 Memory System Integration

Traceability data is stored in DevSynth's memory system:

```python
# Memory storage for traceability data
traceability_memory = {
    "requirement_links": [...],
    "traceability_gaps": [...],
    "coverage_analysis": [...],
    "validation_results": [...],
    "improvement_suggestions": [...]
}
```

### 9.3 Behavior Testing

BDD scenarios for user-facing traceability functionality:

```gherkin
Feature: Requirements Traceability Engine
  As a developer
  I want automated requirements traceability
  So that I can ensure all requirements are properly implemented and tested

  Scenario: Verify complete requirements traceability
    Given I have a requirements traceability matrix
    And I have specifications, code, and tests
    When I verify requirements traceability
    Then the system should validate all requirement references
    And the system should check specification links exist
    And the system should verify code implementation
    And the system should validate test coverage
    And the system should report any missing links

  Scenario: Analyze traceability gaps
    Given I have a project with potential traceability gaps
    When I analyze traceability gaps
    Then the system should identify missing implementations
    And the system should identify missing tests
    And the system should identify missing documentation
    And the system should prioritize gaps by impact
    And the system should suggest remediation actions

  Scenario: Generate traceability report
    Given I have traceability verification results
    When I generate a traceability report
    Then the report should include coverage analysis
    And the report should show gap analysis
    And the report should provide compliance status
    And the report should suggest improvements

  Scenario: Monitor traceability continuously
    Given traceability monitoring is enabled
    When requirements or specifications change
    Then the system should detect traceability impacts
    And the system should generate traceability alerts
    And the system should suggest updates needed
    And the system should track traceability trends

  Scenario: Validate cross-references
    Given I have specifications, code, and tests with references
    When I validate cross-references
    Then the system should verify all references are valid
    And the system should check bidirectional links
    And the system should identify broken references
    And the system should suggest reference fixes
```
