# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- Pending BDD scenarios will verify termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.

A tiered cache improves read performance, but only if it consistently evicts the least recently used entries and reports accurate hit and miss counts.

## Specification
- The cache exposes `get`, `put`, and `remove` operations and maintains at most `max_size` entries.
- Each successful `get` promotes the entry to the most recently used position.
- When inserting a new entry at capacity, the least recently used entry is evicted.
- The memory adapter tracks cache hits and misses via `get_cache_stats`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Cache size never exceeds `max_size` during any access sequence.
- After exceeding capacity, the evicted key is the one least recently accessed.
- Hit and miss counters reflect observed cache behavior.
