# Summary

The feature markers module tracks high-level features via stub functions used for auditing and traceability.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation
Centralizing markers ensures features are discoverable for compliance and auditing processes.

## Specification
- Provide a marker function per tracked feature and expose a
  ``FeatureMarker`` enumeration listing supported markers.
- ``list_feature_markers`` returns all registered marker identifiers.
- Each marker serves as a reference point for requirement coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Auditing tools can locate marker functions for every documented feature.
- Adding a new marker function registers the feature for traceability.
- ``FeatureMarker`` values match the available marker functions.
