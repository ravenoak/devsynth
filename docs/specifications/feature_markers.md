# Summary

The feature markers module tracks high-level features via stub functions used for auditing and traceability.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation
Centralizing markers ensures features are discoverable for compliance and auditing processes.

## Specification
- Provide a marker function per tracked feature.
- Expose a `FeatureMarker` enum that lists discovered marker functions.
- Implement `get_marker` to return the marker callable for a given enum member.
- Each marker serves as a reference point for requirement coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Auditing tools can locate marker functions for every documented feature.
- Enumerating `FeatureMarker` yields all available markers.
- Adding a new marker function registers the feature for traceability.
