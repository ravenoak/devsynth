title: Exceptions Framework
version: 0.1.0-alpha.1
---

# Summary

Defines a structured exception hierarchy for DevSynth to ensure consistent error reporting and handling.

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/exceptions_framework.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/exceptions_framework.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.

A shared base exception simplifies diagnostics and enables uniform error messaging across components.

## Specification
- Provide a `DevSynthError` base class with a `to_dict` method for structured logging.
- Group domain-specific exceptions beneath this base.
- Offer a `log_exception` helper that records a `DevSynthError` via the project logger.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Modules raise subclasses of `DevSynthError` for predictable handling.
- `log_exception` emits structured details when invoked.
- Catching `DevSynthError` captures all framework-defined errors.
