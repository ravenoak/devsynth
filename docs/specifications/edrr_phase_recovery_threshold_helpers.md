# Summary

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem?
- What proofs confirm the solution?

## Motivation

## What proofs confirm the solution?
- BDD scenarios in [`tests/behavior/features/edrr_phase_recovery_threshold_helpers.feature`](../../tests/behavior/features/edrr_phase_recovery_threshold_helpers.feature) ensure termination and expected outcomes.
- Finite state transitions and bounded loops guarantee termination.

The Enhanced EDRR coordinator lacks public helpers to register recovery hooks and adjust phase thresholds, limiting recursive recovery flows and observability.

## Specification
- Expose `register_phase_recovery_hook` and `configure_phase_thresholds` on `EnhancedEDRRCoordinator` to delegate to `PhaseTransitionMetrics`.
- Add `get_thresholds` to `PhaseTransitionMetrics` for retrieving active thresholds.
- Recovery hooks receive phase metrics and may mutate them; returning `{"recovered": True}` stops further hooks and re-evaluates thresholds.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Unit tests cover registering recovery hooks and configuring thresholds.
- Integration tests demonstrate recursive phase transitions using recovery hooks.
