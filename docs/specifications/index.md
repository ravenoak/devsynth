# Specifications

This section contains the official specifications for the DevSynth project, outlining its requirements, features, and intended behavior.

## Core Specifications

- **[DevSynth Specification MVP Updated](devsynth_specification_mvp_updated.md)**: The current authoritative specification for DevSynth.
- **[EDRR Cycle Specification](edrr_cycle_specification.md)**: Specification for the Expand-Differentiate-Refine-Retrospect cycle.
- **[WSDE Interaction Specification](wsde_interaction_specification.md)**: Specification for the Wide Sweep, Deep Exploration interaction model.
- **[Hybrid Memory Architecture](hybrid_memory_architecture.md)**: Specification for DevSynth's hybrid memory architecture.
- **[Interactive Requirements Wizard](interactive_requirements_wizard.md)**: Guided collection of requirements via CLI and WebUI.
- **[Interactive Requirements Gathering](interactive_requirements_gathering.md)**: Wizard for capturing project goals and constraints.

## Implementation Plans

- **[EDRR Framework Integration Plan](edrr_framework_integration_plan.md)**: Plan for integrating the EDRR framework into DevSynth.
- **[Post-MVP Documentation Plan](post_mvp_documentation_plan.md)**: Comprehensive plan for DevSynth's post-MVP documentation structure and organization.
- **[Testing Infrastructure](testing_infrastructure.md)**: Specification for DevSynth's testing infrastructure.

## Historical and Planning Documents

- **[DevSynth Specification](devsynth_specification.md)**: The original high-level specification for DevSynth (superseded by MVP Updated version).
- **[DevSynth Specification MVP](devsynth_specification_mvp.md)**: The initial MVP specification for DevSynth (superseded by MVP Updated version).
- **[Post-MVP Roadmap](post_mvp_roadmap.md)**: Roadmap for development after the MVP.
- **[Executive Summary](executive_summary.md)**: Executive summary of the DevSynth project.
- **[Specification Evaluation](specification_evaluation.md)**: Evaluation of the DevSynth specifications.
- **[EDRR Framework Integration Summary](edrr_framework_integration_summary.md)**: Summary of the EDRR framework integration.

## Overview

The Specifications section provides detailed documentation of DevSynth's design, requirements, and intended behavior. These specifications serve as the authoritative reference for what DevSynth is supposed to do and how it should work.

The Core Specifications include the primary DevSynth specification, which defines the overall system, as well as specifications for key components like the EDRR cycle, WSDE interaction model, and hybrid memory architecture.

The Implementation Plans provide detailed plans for implementing various aspects of DevSynth, including the EDRR framework integration, documentation structure, and testing infrastructure.

The Historical and Planning Documents include earlier versions of specifications, roadmaps, and evaluation documents that provide context and historical perspective on the project's evolution.

## Getting Started

If you're new to DevSynth's specifications, we recommend starting with the [DevSynth Specification MVP Updated](devsynth_specification_mvp_updated.md), which is the current authoritative specification for the entire system. Then, explore the specifications for specific components that interest you, such as the [EDRR Cycle Specification](edrr_cycle_specification.md) or the [Hybrid Memory Architecture](hybrid_memory_architecture.md).
