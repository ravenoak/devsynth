## Overview

The Specifications section provides detailed documentation of DevSynth's design, requirements, and intended behavior. These specifications serve as the authoritative reference for what DevSynth is supposed to do and how it should work.

The Core Specifications include the primary DevSynth specification, which defines the overall system, as well as specifications for key components like the EDRR, WSDE interaction model, and hybrid memory architecture.

The Implementation Plans provide detailed plans for implementing various aspects of DevSynth, including the EDRR framework integration, documentation structure, and testing infrastructure.

The Historical and Planning Documents include earlier versions of specifications, roadmaps, and evaluation documents that provide context and historical perspective on the project's evolution.

## Getting Started

If you're new to DevSynth's specifications, we recommend starting with the [DevSynth Specification MVP Updated](devsynth_specification_mvp_updated.md), which is the current authoritative specification for the entire system. Then, explore the specifications for specific components that interest you, such as the [EDRR Specification](edrr_cycle_specification.md) or the [Hybrid Memory Architecture](hybrid_memory_architecture.md).
