# Agentic Memory Management Specification

## Socratic Checklist
- What is the problem? DevSynth agents lack autonomous context curation and self-improving memory management
- What proofs confirm the solution? Agentic memory techniques enable agents to manage their cognitive workspace autonomously, improving performance on long-horizon tasks

## Motivation

DevSynth's current memory system is passive - agents consume context provided by external systems but cannot autonomously manage, optimize, or evolve their cognitive environment. The document "Contextual Equilibrium" demonstrates that advanced agents need metacognitive capabilities to curate their own context, memory, and reasoning processes.

Agentic memory management shifts from human-engineered context pipelines to autonomous, self-optimizing cognitive architectures where agents actively manage their attention budget and cognitive workspace.

## Specification

### DeepAgents Integration

#### Enhanced Task Decomposition
- **Planning Tools Integration**: Utilize DeepAgents' `write_todos` tool for systematic task breakdown in EDRR Expand phase
- **Hierarchical Sub-agent Spawning**: Leverage DeepAgents' subagent architecture for context isolation in complex tasks
- **Progress Tracking**: Enable autonomous task progress monitoring and adaptation

#### File System Context Management
- **Context Offloading**: Use DeepAgents' file system tools (`ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`) to prevent context window overflow
- **Variable-Length Result Handling**: Manage large tool outputs through external file storage
- **Persistent Context**: Maintain context continuity across agent sessions

#### Long-term Memory Bridge
- **LangGraph Store Integration**: Connect DeepAgents' persistent memory with DevSynth's hybrid memory system
- **Cross-Session Continuity**: Maintain coherent state across extended development cycles
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Ensure critical architectural decisions persist across conversations

### Cognitive Memory Framework

#### Four Memory Types
1. **Parametric Memory**: Knowledge encoded in LLM weights during training
2. **Contextual Memory**: Active working memory in current prompt (attention budget)
3. **External Memory**: Persistent knowledge in vector/graph/structured stores
4. **Episodic/Procedural Memory**: Structured history of interactions and learned procedures

#### Memory State Management
- **Working Memory Limits**: Explicit tracking of token budgets and attention allocation
- **Memory Staleness Prevention**: Mechanisms to maintain consistency across memory types
- **Strategic Forgetting**: Intelligent pruning of outdated or irrelevant information

### Agentic Memory Techniques

#### Compaction
- **Periodic Summarization**: Agents pause to condense conversation history
- **Essential Information Preservation**: Retain critical decisions, architectural choices, and unresolved issues
- **Context Reset**: Clean working memory with compacted summaries

#### Structured Note-Taking
- **Agentic Scratchpad**: External memory for tracking progress and dependencies
- **Strategic Recording**: Autonomous decisions about what information to externalize
- **Retrieval Integration**: Seamless access to recorded notes during task execution

#### Sub-Agent Architectures
- **Task Decomposition**: Break complex problems into specialized sub-tasks
- **Hierarchical Execution**: Manager agents coordinate specialized worker agents
- **Clean Context Boundaries**: Each sub-agent operates with focused, uncontaminated context

### Self-Evolving Context Systems

#### ACE Framework (Agentic Context Engineering)
- **Feedback-Driven Refinement**: Agents modify prompts and context based on execution outcomes
- **Iterative Improvement**: Continuous optimization of cognitive environment
- **Performance Self-Assessment**: Autonomous evaluation of reasoning effectiveness

#### A-Mem (Autonomous Memory Organization)
- **Self-Structuring**: Agents create meaningful links between memories without predefined schemas
- **Organic Knowledge Graphs**: Emergent relationships based on task relevance
- **Contextual Descriptions**: Self-generated metadata for memory organization

### Metacognitive Capabilities

#### Attention Budget Management
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Adjust information priority based on task requirements
- **Signal-to-Noise Optimization**: Filter irrelevant information autonomously
- **Resource Awareness**: Monitor and optimize computational costs

#### Context Self-Curation
- **Relevance Assessment**: Evaluate information value for current tasks
- **Format Optimization**: Transform context for better model comprehension
- **Progressive Refinement**: Iteratively improve context quality

### Long-Horizon Task Support

#### State Persistence
- **Session Continuity**: Maintain coherent state across extended interactions
- **Progress Tracking**: Record and resume complex multi-step processes
- **Outcome Learning**: Capture successful patterns for future application

#### Error Recovery
- **Failure Analysis**: Identify context-related failures and learn from them
- **Adaptive Strategies**: Modify approaches based on observed performance
- **Robust Execution**: Maintain coherence despite partial failures

### Integration with DevSynth Architecture

#### WSDE Model Enhancement
- **Primus Autonomy**: Full context engineering capabilities for lead agents
- **Worker Specialization**: Task-specific context optimization for worker roles
- **Supervisor Oversight**: Quality monitoring of agentic memory decisions

#### EDRR Framework Integration
- **Expand Phase**: Agentic exploration with dynamic context adaptation
- **Differentiate Phase**: Autonomous comparison using structured note-taking
- **Refine Phase**: Self-directed improvement through compaction and feedback
- **Retrospect Phase**: Meta-learning from execution patterns

### Quality Assurance

#### Safety Mechanisms
- **Human Oversight Points**: Configurable intervention for critical decisions
- **Bias Monitoring**: Detect and mitigate self-reinforcing patterns
- **Alignment Verification**: Ensure autonomous behavior aligns with system goals

#### Performance Metrics
- **Task Completion Rate**: Measure improvement in complex task handling
- **Context Efficiency**: Track attention budget utilization and effectiveness
- **Learning Velocity**: Assess rate of autonomous improvement
