# Alignment Checklist for DevSynth SDLC Artifacts

## Purpose

This checklist is designed to help developers ensure alignment between Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) artifacts when making changes to the DevSynth project. Use this checklist during development, code reviews, and before submitting pull requests.

## General Alignment Checks

### Bidirectional Traceability

- [ ] Requirements have forward links to specifications, tests, and code
- [ ] Specifications have backward links to requirements and forward links to tests and code
- [ ] Tests have backward links to specifications and requirements
- [ ] Code has backward links to tests, specifications, and requirements
- [ ] All related artifacts have been reviewed for potential impacts

### Terminology Consistency

- [ ] New terms are consistent with the project glossary
- [ ] Existing terms are used consistently with their defined meanings
- [ ] Capitalization and naming conventions are consistent
- [ ] No undefined acronyms or abbreviations are used

### Documentation Synchronization

- [ ] Documentation reflects the current state of the code
- [ ] README and other user-facing documentation is updated
- [ ] API documentation is updated
- [ ] Comments in code are updated

## Requirements Changes

When changing requirements:

- [ ] Requirement has a unique identifier
- [ ] Requirement is clearly stated and testable
- [ ] Requirement specifies verification method
- [ ] Requirement includes status information
- [ ] Related specifications are identified and updated
- [ ] Related tests are identified and updated
- [ ] Related code is identified and updated
- [ ] Traceability matrix is updated

## Specification Changes

When changing specifications:

- [ ] Specification references the requirements it fulfills
- [ ] Specification is detailed enough for implementation
- [ ] Specification includes test coverage expectations
- [ ] Specification includes implementation notes
- [ ] Specification documents design decisions and alternatives
- [ ] Related tests are identified and updated
- [ ] Related code is identified and updated
- [ ] Traceability matrix is updated

## Test Changes

When changing tests:

- [ ] Test references the specifications it verifies
- [ ] Test indicates which requirements it verifies
- [ ] Test includes or references necessary test data
- [ ] Test covers normal paths, edge cases, and error conditions
- [ ] Test is consistent with specifications and requirements
- [ ] Related code is identified and verified
- [ ] Traceability matrix is updated

## Code Changes

When changing code:

- [ ] Code references related tests
- [ ] Code conforms to specifications
- [ ] Code fulfills requirements
- [ ] Code includes documentation that references specifications and requirements
- [ ] Code follows project coding standards
- [ ] Related tests are updated and pass
- [ ] Related documentation is updated
- [ ] Traceability matrix is updated

## Pre-Pull Request Checks

Before submitting a pull request:

- [ ] All automated alignment checks pass
- [ ] All related artifacts are updated and aligned
- [ ] Changes are documented in the changelog
- [ ] Pull request description references related issues and artifacts
- [ ] Pull request includes updates to traceability matrix if applicable

## Review Checks

When reviewing changes:

- [ ] Changes maintain alignment between artifacts
- [ ] Changes follow the alignment guidelines
- [ ] Changes include updates to all related artifacts
- [ ] Changes include appropriate tests
- [ ] Changes include appropriate documentation

## Post-Implementation Checks

After implementing changes:

- [ ] All requirements are fulfilled
- [ ] Implementation matches specifications
- [ ] Tests cover all aspects of the implementation
- [ ] Documentation reflects the final implementation
- [ ] Traceability matrix is up to date
- [ ] No regressions are introduced

## Handling Misalignments

If misalignments are detected:

- [ ] Issue is documented in the issue tracking system
- [ ] Impact is assessed
- [ ] Priority is assigned
- [ ] Root cause is identified
- [ ] Resolution plan is created
- [ ] Resolution is verified
- [ ] Processes are updated to prevent similar misalignments
