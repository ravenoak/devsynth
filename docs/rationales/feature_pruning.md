# Feature Pruning Rationale

The following placeholder features were removed from the test suite:

- FEATURE_TITLE – template feature file with no implementation.
- Simple Addition (duplicate) – redundant with the example feature.

These removals reduce noise in the dialectical audit and clarify the active feature set.
