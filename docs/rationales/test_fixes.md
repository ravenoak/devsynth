# Test Fixes — Dialectical Review Log

This living log captures rationale for significant test fixes and stability changes using a dialectical workflow. For each notable fix, add a short entry with thesis → antithesis → synthesis and links to code and issues. Keep entries concise (5–10 lines each) and focused on decisions and trade-offs.

## How to use
- When you implement a non-trivial test fix or stabilization, append a new entry below.
- Reference the driving issue or PR and the affected tests/files.
- Prefer neutral, factual descriptions; avoid blame. Align with project guidelines and docs/plan.md.

## Template

```text
Title: <Short description>
Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Tests/Files: <paths or patterns>
Issue/PR: <#NNN or link>

Thesis: <Original assumption about the failure or design>
Antithesis: <Counter-argument or observed contradictory behavior>
Synthesis: <Final approach/decision and why it resolves the tension>
Follow-ups: <Optional: additional TODOs or monitoring steps>
```

## Entries

- Title: Enhanced test parser parity exercise and JSON reporting
  Date: 2025-08-26
  Tests/Files: scripts/enhanced_test_parser.py, scripts/diagnostics/run_enhanced_parser_parity.sh, docs/testing/parity/enhanced_parser_parity.md; docs/tasks.md (Task 30)
  Issue/PR: Task 30 in docs/tasks.md

  Thesis: AST-based parsing diverged from pytest collection in edge cases, but we lacked a standard, reproducible way to quantify and track parity over time.
  Antithesis: Forcing perfect parity is impractical given runtime/dynamic generation and plugin effects; over-fitting risks complexity and maintenance burden.
  Synthesis: Added a parity workflow that compares against pytest and emits a JSON artifact under test_reports/. Documented known limitations and interpretation guidance. This enables evidence-based enhancements without mandating brittle equivalence.
  Follow-ups: If large, repeated patterns appear in only_in_pytest, add focused TestVisitor improvements guarded by unit tests.

- Title: Enforce per-function speed markers; disallow module-level pytestmark
  Date: 2025-08-26
  Tests/Files: scripts/verify_test_markers.py; docs/tasks.md (Task 3)
  Issue/PR: Task 3 in docs/tasks.md

  Thesis: Developers sometimes used module-level pytestmark for speed categories, assuming it satisfied marker discipline.
  Antithesis: Guidelines require exactly one speed marker per test function; module-level markers hide per-test intent and break segmentation.
  Synthesis: Updated verifier to detect module-level pytestmark carrying speed markers and treat them as violations (function "<module>"); this ensures the tool fails when module-level speed markers are present and nudges tests to per-function markers.
  Follow-ups: None for now; consider adding autofix hints in scripts/apply_test_markers.py.

- Title: Release documentation consolidation (Playbook, Readiness, Post-release)
  Date: 2025-08-26
  Tests/Files: docs/release/release_playbook.md, docs/release/release_readiness.md, docs/release/post_release_validation.md, mkdocs.yml, README.md
  Issue/PR: tasks 70, 75, 76, 77, 78

  Thesis: Release steps were scattered across workflows and notes, causing drift and discoverability issues.
  Antithesis: Over-consolidating could duplicate CI logic and add maintenance overhead.
  Synthesis: Added a concise Release Playbook and checklists, linking to existing workflows and keeping single sources of truth for automation; updated nav and README to reduce friction without duplicating logic.
  Follow-ups: Review packaging sanity nuances (templates inclusion) before GA; consider automation that validates Playbook steps.

- Title: Seed flakiness in retrieval pipeline
  Date: 2025-08-26
  Tests/Files: tests/integration/test_retrieval_pipeline.py::test_topk_ordering
  Issue/PR: #000 (example)

  Thesis: Ordering depended on Python dict iteration; assumed stable.
  Antithesis: Randomized set ordering caused nondeterministic results under xdist.
  Synthesis: Introduced deterministic_seed fixture usage and explicit sort by score; marked @pytest.mark.isolation until shared cache is removed.
  Follow-ups: Remove isolation marker once cache is fixture-scoped.

- Title: Gate WebUI behavior tests with explicit gui marker
  Date: 2025-08-26
  Tests/Files: tests/behavior/test_webui_diagnostics_audit.py, tests/behavior/test_cli_webui_parity.py; docs/tasks.md (Task 38)
  Issue/PR: Task 38 in docs/tasks.md

  Thesis: WebUI behavior tests relied only on resource guards; some tooling and contributor workflows filter by gui marker to include/exclude GUI-related tests consistently.
  Antithesis: Adding another marker could be redundant since resource gating already prevents accidental collection; extra markers risk over-segmentation if misused.
  Synthesis: Added @pytest.mark.gui alongside existing requires_resource("webui")/"cli" guards to align with GUI Testing Guide and allow explicit opt-in via -m gui without weakening resource gating.
  Follow-ups: Audit any remaining UI/API tests for consistent categorization; document policy in docs/testing/gui_testing.md (already present).

- Title: Extracted core test fixtures into tests/fixtures/ and imported via conftest
  Date: 2025-08-26
  Tests/Files: tests/conftest.py; tests/fixtures/determinism.py; tests/fixtures/networking.py; tests/fixtures/resources.py; docs/tasks.md (Task 61)
  Issue/PR: Task 61 in docs/tasks.md

  Thesis: The monolithic tests/conftest.py concentrated many responsibilities (determinism, network isolation, resource helpers), making it harder to navigate, review, and evolve.
  Antithesis: Splitting too aggressively risks circular imports and hidden behavior changes that destabilize the suite.
  Synthesis: Extracted deterministic_seed, enforce_test_timeout, disable_network, and is_property_testing_enabled into focused modules under tests/fixtures/, then imported them from conftest. Behavior is unchanged; readability and maintainability improve, aligning with project guidelines and docs/plan.md.
  Follow-ups: Consider extracting resource availability checkers next, coordinating with scripts/verify_resource_markers.py expectations.

- Title: Close the loop on tasks checklist bookkeeping
  Date: 2025-08-26
  Tests/Files: docs/tasks.md, docs/rationales/test_fixes.md
  Issue/PR: docs/tasks.md Task 80

  Thesis: The checklist reflected a completed state for many items but lacked an explicit "close the loop" confirmation, risking drift between docs and work completed.
  Antithesis: Marking completion without capturing rationale could obscure traceability and reduce learning from the stabilization process.
  Synthesis: Marked Task 80 as complete in docs/tasks.md and added this concise rationale entry to preserve accountability and trace decisions. Changes align with project guidelines (clarity, traceability) and docs/plan.md (iterative stabilization).
  Follow-ups: As additional remaining tasks are completed (e.g., coverage ratcheting, mypy strictness), append focused rationale entries and keep the checklist synchronized.
