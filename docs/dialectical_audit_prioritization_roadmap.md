## Remediation Strategy by Category

### For Tests Without Documentation (Category 1 - 120+ instances)
**Approach**: Specification-Driven Development
1. **Analyze Tests**: Extract requirements from existing test implementations
2. **Create Specs**: Write formal specifications in `docs/specifications/`
3. **Validate Alignment**: Ensure specs match implementation behavior
4. **Update Traceability**: Link specs to tests in RTM

**Phase Distribution**:
- Phase 1: 25-30 critical features (core APIs, memory, providers)
- Phase 2: 40-45 workflow features (EDRR, CLI, testing)
- Phase 3: 50-55 advanced features (WebUI, reasoning, docs)

### For Documentation Without Tests (Category 2 - 60+ instances)
**Approach**: Test-Driven Development
1. **Review Specs**: Analyze existing specification requirements
2. **Create BDD Scenarios**: Write Gherkin features in `tests/behavior/features/`
3. **Implement Tests**: Add unit and integration tests
4. **Validate Coverage**: Ensure tests cover all spec requirements

**Phase Distribution**:
- Phase 1: 5-10 core features
- Phase 2: 15-20 workflow features
- Phase 3: 35-40 advanced features

### For Referenced but Not Implemented (Category 3 - Cleanup)
**Approach**: Reference Cleanup
1. **Audit Usage**: Find where features are referenced
2. **Remove References**: Clean up docs, tests, and inventories
3. **Update Indexes**: Remove from feature lists and roadmaps

**Phase Distribution**: All cleanup in Phase 3 (low priority)

## Success Metrics and Validation

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- Core APIs fully documented and tested
- Memory system specifications complete
- Provider integration gaps resolved
- Dialectical audit shows 60+ gaps resolved

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- EDRR workflow fully specified and tested
- CLI functionality gaps addressed
- Testing infrastructure complete
- Dialectical audit shows 40+ additional gaps resolved

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- All remaining gaps addressed
- WebUI specifications complete
- Reference cleanup finished
- Dialectical audit passes with 0 questions

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strict phase boundaries prevent expansion
- **Quality Issues**: Each gap remediation includes review
- **Timeline Slip**: Parallel workstreams for different priorities

### Business Risks
- **Feature Gaps**: Prioritization focuses on business-critical features first
- **User Impact**: Core functionality addressed before nice-to-haves
- **Maintenance Burden**: Documentation debt reduced systematically

## Resource Allocation

### Team Composition
- **Lead Developer**: Phase 1 (core infrastructure)
- **QA Engineer**: Phase 2 (testing and workflow)
- **Documentation Specialist**: Phase 3 (cleanup and advanced features)

### Parallel Workstreams
- **Specification Writing**: Can proceed independently of test implementation
- **Test Creation**: Can be done in parallel with spec writing
- **Review and Validation**: Required for all changes

## Next Steps

1. **Kickoff Phase 1**: Begin with core API documentation
2. **Establish Cadence**: Weekly checkpoints on gap resolution progress
3. **Track Metrics**: Monitor dialectical audit pass rate improvement
4. **Adjust Priorities**: Re-evaluate based on business needs and technical discoveries
