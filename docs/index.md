# DevSynth Documentation

Welcome to the DevSynth documentation! This site provides comprehensive guides, references, and policies for users and contributors. Use the navigation to explore getting started guides, user and developer documentation, architecture, technical references, specifications, and the project roadmap.

## Quick Links

- [Quick Start Guide](getting_started/quick_start_guide.md)
- [User Guide](user_guides/user_guide.md)
- [Developer Guides](developer_guides/contributing.md)
- [Architecture Overview](architecture/overview.md)
- [API Reference](technical_reference/api_reference/index.md)
- [Project Roadmap](roadmap/post_mvp_roadmap.md)

## Project Policies

See [Documentation Policies](roadmap/documentation_plan.md) and [Contributing Guide](developer_guides/contributing.md) for standards and review processes.

## SDLC Policies and Documentation Framework

DevSynth is governed by a comprehensive set of SDLC policies and documentation artifacts designed for both human and agentic contributors. These policies ensure structure, boundaries, and direction across all SDLC phases, supporting multi-agent collaboration, compliance, safety, and productivity. Key elements include:

- **Requirements Documentation**: Product Requirements Document (PRD), domain glossary, and requirements traceability matrix ([requirements_traceability.md](requirements_traceability.md))
- **Design Documentation**: Architecture specs, design principles, API/data schemas, and security design ([architecture/overview.md](architecture/overview.md))
- **Development Protocols**: Contribution guide, code style, module ownership, secure coding, and peer review ([developer_guides/contributing.md](developer_guides/contributing.md), [developer_guides/code_style.md](developer_guides/code_style.md))
- **Testing Strategy**: Test plan, unit/integration/property-based/regression tests, CI coverage, and testing documentation ([developer_guides/testing.md](developer_guides/testing.md))
- **Deployment & Maintenance**: Infrastructure-as-code, deployment workflow, access control, observability, rollback, and maintenance plan ([policies/deployment.md](policies/deployment.md), [policies/maintenance.md](policies/maintenance.md))
- **Repository Structure & Metadata**: Predictable directory layout, file/symbol annotations, metadata tags, and an automated knowledge base for agentic retrieval ([roadmap/documentation_plan.md](roadmap/documentation_plan.md))

For a detailed rationale and best practices for agentic LLM projects, see [SDLC Policies and Repository Artifacts for Agentic LLM Projects](scratch_2.md).

## Documentation Restructuring & Navigation

The documentation corpus is organized for clarity and agentic navigation, following the [Documentation Restructuring Plan](roadmap/documentation_plan.md):

- `getting_started/` – Quick start, installation, and basic usage
- `user_guides/` – User guide, CLI reference, configuration
- `developer_guides/` – Contributing, development setup, testing, code style
- `architecture/` – System, agent, memory, and reasoning architecture
- `technical_reference/` – API, error handling, performance
- `specifications/` – Current and archived specifications
- `roadmap/` – Roadmaps and improvement plans
- `policies/` – SDLC, security, testing, and maintenance policies

The [mkdocs.yml](../mkdocs.yml) file provides a navigable structure for all documentation. A [RepoStructure.md](repo_structure.md) (planned) and autogenerated indices will provide a navigable map for both human and agentic contributors.

## Documentation Quality & Continuous Improvement

- All requirements, code, and tests are linked via the [Requirements Traceability Matrix](requirements_traceability.md)
- Documentation, code, and tests are kept in sync through regular audits, metadata tagging, and automated CI/CD
- Changelog and semantic versioning ensure all changes are tracked ([../CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md))
- Documentation review, testing, and style policies are enforced ([roadmap/documentation_plan.md](roadmap/documentation_plan.md))
