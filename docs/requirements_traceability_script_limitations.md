# Requirements Traceability Script Limitations

The `scripts/verify_requirements_traceability.py` script checks that each requirement in `docs/requirements_traceability.md` links to code and tests. While useful, it has several limitations:

- It only verifies that the code and test reference cells are non-empty; it does not confirm that the referenced modules or tests actually exist.
- Requirements with fewer than six table columns are ignored, allowing malformed rows to pass.
- Only rows beginning with `| FR`, `| NFR`, or `| IR` are evaluated; other requirement types are skipped.
- Duplicate requirement identifiers are not detected.
- The parser assumes a simple pipe-delimited format and may misinterpret rows with embedded pipe characters or multiline cells.
- Placeholder text such as `TODO` or `TBD` is treated as a valid reference.
- Table structure, headers, and column alignment are not validated.

These edge cases could allow traceability gaps to go unnoticed. Enhancements to the script could include verifying file paths, detecting duplicate IDs, and validating the overall structure of the traceability matrix.
