# Sprint-EDRR Integration: Implementation Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines a concrete strategy for aligning DevSynth's "Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect" (EDRR) methodology with traditional Agile sprint practices. This integration enhances DevSynth's ability to function as an effective SDLC tool by structuring its iterative processes within a familiar sprint framework.

**Implementation Status:** Basic sprint alignment helpers exist, but full automation of sprint ceremonies within the EDRR workflow is ongoing.

> **Note**: This document describes just one of several ways to integrate EDRR into your development workflow. If your team uses a different methodology, see the [Methodology Integration Framework](./methodology_integration_framework.md) for alternative approaches or how to customize DevSynth to your specific needs.

## 1. Core Principles of Integration

1. **Time-Boxed Iterations**: Each EDRR operates within a defined sprint duration (typically 1-2 weeks)
2. **Measurable Outcomes**: Each phase and overall cycle has quantifiable success metrics
3. **Ceremonial Alignment**: Traditional sprint ceremonies map to EDRR activities
4. **Incremental Value**: Each cycle delivers concrete, measurable value
5. **Adaptation**: The process evolves based on retrospectives and changing project needs


## 2. Sprint-EDRR Structural Mapping

### 2.1 Sprint Planning → Retrospect (Iteration Planning)

The Retrospect phase's "Iteration Planning" step serves the same function as sprint planning:

- Defines scope and objectives for the next cycle
- Establishes success criteria and metrics
- Allocates resources and prioritizes work
- Identifies risks and mitigation strategies


**Implementation Actions:**

- Enhance the `Ingestion.retrospect_phase()` method to generate a formal iteration plan
- Create a `SprintPlan` data structure to store objectives, metrics, and priorities
- Implement a planning review step requiring stakeholder approval before proceeding to the next Expand phase
- Align sprint planning with results from requirement analysis


### 2.2 Daily Stand-ups → Phase Progression Tracking

Traditional daily stand-ups are paralleled by tracking progression through EDRR phases:

- Regular status updates as phases progress
- Identification of blockers and impediments
- Cross-team synchronization
- Short-term adjustments as needed


**Implementation Actions:**

- Add `daily_status_update()` method to the Ingestion class
- Create a notification system for phase progress and blockers
- Implement metrics dashboards that update in real-time
- Schedule automated daily status reports


### 2.3 Sprint Review → Refine Phase Outputs

The outputs from the Refine phase serve as the equivalent of sprint review deliverables:

- Demonstration of refined project model
- Presentation of new insights and relationships
- Verification of met objectives from the plan
- Collection of stakeholder feedback


**Implementation Actions:**

- Enhance the `Ingestion.refine_phase()` to generate formal review artifacts
- Create visualization tools for demonstrating the refined project model
- Implement feedback collection mechanisms
- Add formal acceptance criteria validation


### 2.4 Sprint Retrospective → Retrospect Phase

The Retrospect phase naturally aligns with sprint retrospectives:

- Analysis of what went well or poorly
- Identification of improvement opportunities
- Process adjustment for next iteration
- Team learning and growth


**Implementation Actions:**

- Extend the `Ingestion.retrospect_phase()` with structured retrospective analysis
- Implement tracking of retrospective insights across iterations
- Create a mechanism for process improvement suggestions
- Develop metrics for measuring improvement over time
- Automate evaluation of retrospective data in the EDRR review process

### 2.5 Automated Planning and Retrospective Mapping

DevSynth's `SprintAdapter` now automatically converts requirement
analysis outputs from the Expand phase into a structured sprint plan and
summarizes Retrospect phase results for sprint metrics. These mappings are
implemented in `devsynth.application.sprint.planning` and
`devsynth.application.sprint.retrospective`.


## 3. Time-Boxing EDRR Cycles

### 3.1 Sprint Duration Alignment

Configure EDRR cycles to align with organizational sprint cadences:

- Typical Options: 1-week, 2-week, or 3-week cycles
- Default Recommendation: 2-week cycles for most projects


**Implementation Actions:**

- Add configuration option for sprint duration
- Implement phase duration recommendations based on total cycle length
- Create progress measurement based on time elapsed vs. expected


### 3.2 Phase Time Allocation

Allocate percentages of the sprint to each EDRR phase:

- Expand: 30% of sprint duration
- Differentiate: 30% of sprint duration
- Refine: 25% of sprint duration
- Retrospect: 15% of sprint duration


**Implementation Actions:**

- Add phase duration tracking to `IngestionMetrics`
- Implement warnings when phases exceed allocated time
- Create dynamic time allocation based on project size and complexity


### 3.3 Time-Box Enforcement

Ensure phases complete within their allocated time:

- Hard deadlines for phase completion
- Scope reduction mechanisms when time constraints are threatened
- Escalation paths for significant delays


**Implementation Actions:**

- Add timeout mechanisms to phase execution
- Implement scope prioritization for time-constrained execution
- Create notification system for impending time-box violations


## 4. Metrics-Driven Evaluation

### 4.1 Sprint-Level Metrics

Measure overall sprint effectiveness:

- Planned vs. Actual Scope Coverage: % of planned artifacts processed
- Quality Metrics: Inconsistencies identified and resolved
- Model Improvement: Measurable enhancement to project understanding
- Learning Rate: New patterns discovered and documented


**Implementation Actions:**

- Extend `IngestionMetrics` with sprint-level KPIs
- Create visualization dashboards for sprint metrics
- Implement trend analysis across multiple sprints


### 4.2 Phase-Specific Metrics

Track effectiveness of individual phases:

- Expand: Coverage, discovery rate, data quality
- Differentiate: Validation accuracy, gap detection rate
- Refine: Model coherence, query performance, relationship density
- Retrospect: Insight quality, planning accuracy


**Implementation Actions:**

- Add phase-specific metrics to each phase implementation
- Create benchmarks for expected performance
- Implement automatic flagging of metric anomalies


### 4.3 Value Delivery Metrics

Measure concrete value delivered each sprint:

- New Knowledge: Quantified amount of new information integrated
- Issue Resolution: Number of inconsistencies or gaps addressed
- Query Capability: Improvements in information retrieval success
- Adaptation Speed: Time to incorporate project changes


**Implementation Actions:**

- Implement value quantification algorithms
- Create "Definition of Done" criteria for EDRR cycles
- Add stakeholder value assessment mechanisms


## 5. Integration with DevSynth CLI
