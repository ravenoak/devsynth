# Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect: DevSynth's Universal Iterative Methodology

## Overview

This document describes DevSynth's four-phase iterative approach that serves as the core methodology for all system processes. Originally developed for project ingestion, this dialectical methodology has evolved into DevSynth's fundamental approach for any task requiring iterative improvement and multi-disciplinary reasoning.

**Implementation Status:** The EDRR framework is fully implemented. Phase behaviors, automation hooks, and recursion controls are now part of the core system.

The methodology enables DevSynth to tackle complex problems through a systematic cycle of bottom-up discovery, top-down validation, synthesis, and learning. While this document initially describes the process in the context of project ingestion, the principles apply universally across all DevSynth operations.

> **Note**: While EDRR provides a logical progression for complex problem-solving, DevSynth does not require teams to adopt any specific workflow or timing for these phases. See the [Methodology Integration Framework](./methodology_integration_framework.md) for details on how to adapt EDRR to your team's preferred way of working.

## The Four Phases

### 1. Expand (Bottom-Up Integration)

The Expand phase performs a comprehensive bottom-up analysis, gathering all available information without filtering or interpretation. This phase is guided by the strategic plan and priorities established during the Iteration Planning step of the previous cycle's Retrospect phase.

**Process:**
1. **Scope Application**: Apply the defined boundaries and priorities from the previous Retrospect phase
2. **Discovery**: Scan the entire project filesystem to identify all files
3. **Classification**: Determine file types and group related artifacts
4. **Extraction**: Parse content and metadata from each file
5. **Initial Indexing**: Build a raw, unfiltered index of discovered artifacts

**Examples:**
- Apply strategic focus areas from the previous Retrospect to target key components first
- Parse Python files to extract class/function definitions, docstrings, and dependencies
- Analyze test files to identify test cases and covered functionality
- Extract structure and content from documentation files
- Record filesystem organization and naming patterns
- Follow the risk mitigation strategies identified in the previous cycle

**Outputs:**
- Scoped discovery report reflecting applied priorities and boundaries
- Complete inventory of project artifacts
- Raw extracted content and metadata
- Initial dependency and relationship graphs
- Potential structural patterns

### 2. Differentiate (Top-Down Validation)

The Differentiate phase compares the discovered artifacts against declared project structure and higher-level definitions, identifying discrepancies and organizing information hierarchically.

**Process:**
1. **Manifest Validation**: Compare discovered artifacts against the project `.devsynth/project.yaml`
2. **Structure Analysis**: Validate project structure against declared patterns (monorepo, standard layouts, etc.)
3. **Consistency Checking**: Identify inconsistencies between different artifact types (e.g., documented features without tests)
4. **Gap Analysis**: Detect missing artifacts, coverage gaps, or undocumented components
5. **Change Detection**: When rerunning the process, identify changes since the last analysis

**Examples:**
- Validate that all components defined in `.devsynth/project.yaml` exist in the codebase
- Check that the actual directory structure matches the declared project type
- Cross-reference requirements with implementations and tests
- Identify undocumented public APIs

**Outputs:**
- Structured project model with hierarchical relationships
- Identified inconsistencies and gaps
- Artifact status classification (new, changed, outdated, deprecated)
- Compliance report against project standards

### 3. Refine (Hygiene, Resilience, and Integration)

The Refine phase synthesizes findings into a cohesive model, integrating new information while preserving important historical context and essential relationships.

**Process:**
1. **Context Merging**: Integrate new findings with previously established context
2. **Pruning & Archiving**: Identify and archive outdated information
3. **Relationship Strengthening**: Reinforce key relationships between artifacts
4. **Knowledge Compression**: Optimize the model for efficient storage and retrieval
5. **Verification**: Validate the refined model against project requirements and tests

**Examples:**
- Preserve important decision records while archiving obsolete details
- Update the project model while maintaining consistency with prior understanding
- Generate comprehensive relationship graphs showing connections between code, tests, and docs
- Optimize the model for efficient query and retrieval

**Outputs:**
- Coherent, up-to-date project model
- Efficient knowledge representation for retrieval
- Context graph with weighted relationships
- Actionable insights and recommendations for project improvement

### 4. Retrospect (Learning and Evolution)

The Retrospect phase evaluates the outcomes of the previous three phases, captures insights, and guides the evolution of future iterations.

**Process:**
1. **Outcome Analysis**: Assess the quality and usefulness of results from the Refine phase
2. **Methodology Evaluation**: Identify strengths and weaknesses in the current process
3. **Insight Capture**: Document lessons learned and unexpected discoveries
4. **Knowledge Integration**: Update system knowledge and heuristics based on findings
5. **Iteration Planning**: Define scope, objectives, strategies, and success criteria for the next cycle of Expand-Differentiate-Refine

**Examples:**
- Evaluate the accuracy of the project model against actual developer experience
- Identify patterns of missing or misclassified artifacts to improve future discovery
- Document reasoning processes that led to successful or unsuccessful outcomes
- Refine heuristics for context preservation during the Refine phase
- Adjust criteria for the Differentiate phase based on observed false positives/negatives

**Outputs:**
- Retrospective analysis document with key findings
- Updated process parameters and heuristics
- Knowledge base entries for recurring patterns
- Adjusted strategies for subsequent iterations
- Learning signals for system improvement
- Strategic plan for the next iteration cycle
- Prioritized focus areas and defined boundaries
- Resource allocation recommendations
- Risk mitigation strategies

## The Continuous Improvement Cycle

The four phases form a continuous cycle, with each phase building on the previous. The critical planning function naturally bridges the Retrospect and Expand phases, creating a complete loop of learning and application:

```

│        │                                                       ▼       │
│        │                                                                │
│        │         ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐           │
│        │         │                                         │           │
│        └─────────┤             PLANNING BRIDGE             │◀──────────┘
│                  │                                         │            
│                  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘            
│                                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This cyclical nature is essential to the methodology's effectiveness. Rather than treating planning as a separate phase, it functions as a critical bridge between cycles. The "Iteration Planning" step of the Retrospect phase and the "Scope Application" step of the Expand phase together form a complete planning function that:

1. **Evaluates outcomes** from the previous cycle
2. **Formulates strategy** based on those learnings
3. **Defines priorities and boundaries** for the next cycle
4. **Applies those decisions** to guide the bottom-up discovery process

This integrated approach ensures planning is always informed by recent outcomes and directly applied to upcoming work, creating a more adaptive and responsive system than a separate planning phase would allow.

For the initial cycle when no previous Retrospect phase exists, DevSynth provides default planning parameters or requires minimal initialization inputs from the user to establish initial scope and priorities.

## Planning Within the Iterative Cycle

Rather than treating planning as a separate, distinct phase, planning in DevSynth functions as an integrated element that exists at the junction between iterations:

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This diagram illustrates how planning manifests at multiple points within the cycle:

1. **Initial Planning** occurs at the beginning of the first iteration before an Expand phase has been completed. For new projects, this establishes the initial scope and objectives.

2. **Bridge Planning** occurs at the critical junction between cycles, where Retrospect directly feeds into the next Expand phase. This is where planning is most powerful, as it incorporates learning from the previous cycle.

3. **In-Phase Planning** elements exist within each phase as tactical planning to execute that phase effectively.

The system's design recognizes that different contexts call for different planning approaches. In some situations (like initial project setup), planning may appear to be a distinct first step, while in ongoing development it functions as the bridge between cycles.

This flexible approach ensures planning is always present where needed, without rigidly prescribing it as a separate phase that might disrupt the natural flow of the iterative process.

## Implementation in DevSynth

The "Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect" process is implemented through:

1. **`devsynth ingest` CLI Command**: Triggers the full ingestion pipeline
   - `--expand-only`: Performs only the initial discovery phase
   - `--no-differentiate`: Skips the validation and differentiation phase
   - `--no-refine`: Skips the refinement phase
   - `--no-retrospect`: Skips the retrospective phase
   - `--dry-run`: Shows what would be processed without making changes
   - `--verbose`: Provides detailed progress information

2. **Ingestion Pipeline**: Implemented in `src/devsynth/application/ingestion.py`
   - Utilizes the Memory and Context System for efficient storage and retrieval
   - Processes the project according to the structure defined in `.devsynth/project.yaml`
   - Adapts to different project layouts (monorepos, multi-language, etc.)

3. **Progress Feedback**: The process provides clear feedback during execution
   - Shows each phase with progress indicators
   - Reports key statistics and findings
   - Visualizes the evolving project model

4. **Output Formats**:
   - Structured JSON for machine consumption
   - Human-readable reports for developers
   - Visual graph representation of project components and relationships

## Configuring Project Structure in `.devsynth/project.yaml`

The `.devsynth/project.yaml` file serves as the authoritative declaration of project structure and organization. It allows users to define how DevSynth should interpret their specific project layout.

### Example Configuration for Different Project Types

**Standard Python Package:**
```yaml
projectStructure:
  type: "python-package"
  rootModule: "src/mypackage"
  testDir: "tests"
  docsDir: "docs"
```

**Monorepo with Multiple Services:**
```yaml
projectStructure:
  type: "monorepo"
  services:
    - name: "backend-api"
      path: "services/backend"
      language: "python"
      rootModule: "services/backend/src/api"
    - name: "frontend"
      path: "services/frontend"
      language: "typescript"
      rootModule: "services/frontend/src"
  sharedModules:
    - path: "shared/utils"
      language: "python"
  testStrategy: "per-service"
```

**Multi-Language Application:**
```yaml
projectStructure:
  type: "multi-language"
  components:
    - name: "core-logic"
      path: "src/core"
      language: "python"
    - name: "web-interface"
      path: "src/web"
      language: "javascript"
  buildSystem: "custom"
  buildFile: "build.py"
```

## Applying the Methodology Beyond Project Ingestion

While initially developed for project ingestion, the Expand-Differentiate-Refine-Retrospect methodology applies to numerous processes throughout DevSynth:

### Code Generation and Implementation

1. **Expand**: Gather all relevant requirements, context, existing code, patterns, and constraints
2. **Differentiate**: Validate requirements against each other, identify conflicts, prioritize features, and determine implementation approach
3. **Refine**: Generate coherent, optimized implementation that satisfies requirements and integrates with existing codebase
4. **Retrospect**: Evaluate code quality, test results, and performance against requirements, capturing lessons for future implementations

### Testing and Quality Assurance

1. **Expand**: Discover all testable aspects of the system, collect existing tests, and identify coverage gaps
2. **Differentiate**: Classify test types, prioritize based on risk and importance, and validate against requirements
3. **Refine**: Generate optimized test suite with appropriate coverage and minimal redundancy
4. **Retrospect**: Analyze test results, improve test strategies, and refine heuristics for test generation

### Documentation Generation

1. **Expand**: Gather all sources of information (code, comments, tests, specifications, etc.)
2. **Differentiate**: Organize information hierarchically, identify target audiences, and validate completeness
3. **Refine**: Generate coherent, consistent documentation optimized for the intended audience
4. **Retrospect**: Collect feedback, identify areas for improvement, and refine documentation strategies

### Debugging and Problem-Solving

1. **Expand**: Collect all relevant logs, error reports, code snippets, and environmental information
2. **Differentiate**: Analyze patterns, identify potential causes, and prioritize hypotheses
3. **Refine**: Develop and implement solution strategies, validating fixes against the identified issues
4. **Retrospect**: Document root causes, solution patterns, and prevention strategies for future reference

## Current Limitations

- Full automation of phase transitions is still in development.
- Monitoring and visualization tools are minimal.
- Integration with WSDE collaboration features remains experimental.

## Conclusion

The "Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect" methodology represents DevSynth's universal dialectical approach to complex problem-solving. By systematically moving through these four phases across all operations, DevSynth implements a consistent reasoning framework that supports continuous improvement and adaptation.

This iterative, multi-disciplinary approach enables DevSynth to:

1. **Build comprehensive understanding** through systematic bottom-up discovery
2. **Validate against established structures** through rigorous top-down analysis
3. **Synthesize coherent outputs** through intelligent integration and optimization
4. **Learn and evolve** through systematic retrospection and knowledge capture

By applying this methodology across all aspects of software development—from project ingestion to code generation, testing, documentation, and debugging—DevSynth creates a unified cognitive framework that supports both autonomous and collaborative workflows while maintaining traceability, reliability, and continuous improvement.

The methodology's flexibility allows it to be applied at varying scales, from small-scope tasks to large-scale system design, making it the fundamental reasoning pattern that underlies all of DevSynth's intelligent operations.
