## Overview

The Technical Reference section provides detailed, technical documentation for developers working with DevSynth. It includes API references, implementation details, and technical specifications for various components of the system.

This section is intended for developers who need to understand the technical details of DevSynth's implementation, either to contribute to the project or to integrate it with other systems. It complements the higher-level documentation found in the Architecture and Developer Guides sections.

The API Reference provides comprehensive documentation of DevSynth's public APIs, including classes, methods, and functions. It is automatically generated from the codebase to ensure it stays up-to-date with the implementation.

The Error Handling documentation describes how errors are handled in DevSynth, including the error hierarchy, error codes, and best practices for error handling in different parts of the system.

The Methodologies and Frameworks section provides technical details about the methodologies and frameworks used in DevSynth, including the EDRR methodology and its integration with other development methodologies.

The Utilities and Tools section documents various utilities and tools that are part of DevSynth, including the knowledge graph utilities.

## Getting Started

If you're new to DevSynth's technical details, we recommend starting with the [API Reference](api_reference/index.md) to get a sense of the available functionality. Then, explore the [Error Handling](error_handling.md) documentation to understand how errors are handled in the system.
