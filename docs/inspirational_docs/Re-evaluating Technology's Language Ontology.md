## **Introduction: The Politics of Technological Language**

The language used to describe technology is not a neutral or objective reflection of reality. It is a performative social practice that actively constructs relationships, embeds power dynamics, and naturalizes the dominant ideologies of its time. The contemporary lexicon of software and digital systems—populated by 'users', 'owners', 'producers', and 'consumers'—is deeply entangled with the logic of late-stage capitalism. This report posits that a conscious, critical reshaping of this language is a necessary act of political intervention for imagining and building post-capitalist technological futures. The central thesis is that by deconstructing the current terminology, we can expose its inherent biases and construct a new ontology that fosters values of collaboration, stewardship, and equity rather than control, consumption, and extraction.

To undertake this broad critical evaluation, this report employs a multi-disciplinary methodological framework. The overarching structure is guided by dialectical reasoning, proceeding through a triadic process of Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis.1 The current technological lexicon, understood as a coherent system, constitutes the *Thesis*. The critical deconstruction of this lexicon, exposing its internal contradictions and ideological underpinnings, forms the *Antithesis*. The proposal of a new, future-forward ontology grounded in post-capitalist principles represents the *Synthesis*. This approach embraces contradiction not as a flaw to be eliminated but as the essential engine of progress and development.3

The *Antithesis* phase will be driven by the Socratic method. Through a form of cooperative, argumentative dialogue, this analysis will pose a series of relentless questions to the established lexicon to reveal its unexamined assumptions and prove the fallacy of its initial premises.5 This method of inquiry is not about winning an argument but about collaboratively seeking a deeper, more precise understanding by exposing internal inconsistencies.7

The *Thesis* and *Synthesis* phases are informed by systems and holistic thinking. Systems thinking provides a language for understanding and communicating complexity and interdependencies, allowing for the mapping of the current lexicon as a system of interconnected, mutually reinforcing parts.9 Holistic thinking, which posits that the parts of a system are inseparable from the whole and cannot be understood in isolation, guides the construction of the new ontology.11 This ensures the proposed alternative is not merely a list of replacement words but a coherent, interconnected linguistic framework that embodies a different worldview.13

This report situates itself within a constellation of academic disciplines. It draws from Science and Technology Studies (STS), particularly its critique of technological determinism and its focus on the social construction of technology.15 It utilizes the Critical Theory of Technology (CTT) to analyze how power and social values are inscribed into technical systems and their language.17 It engages with research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) on the framing of human-computer relationships and the ethics of design.18 Finally, it applies the tools of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to systematically uncover how language functions as a form of social practice that reproduces ideology and power relations.20 By synthesizing these approaches, this report aims to fill a gap in the literature, moving beyond the critique of individual "problematic terms" to a systemic evaluation and reconstruction of the entire technological lexicon with the explicit goal of building a post-capitalist alternative.

## **Part I: The Lexicon of Control and Consumption: An Ontology of Capitalist Technology (The Thesis)**

This section establishes the *Thesis* of the dialectical inquiry by mapping the current technological lexicon as a coherent, self-reinforcing system that reflects and reproduces capitalist values. Employing a systems thinking approach, the analysis demonstrates how these terms are not isolated but form a "closed interdependency" that naturalizes a worldview based on hierarchy, property, and transactional exchange.10

### **The Abstraction of the Human: From Person to 'User'**

The term 'user' is arguably the cornerstone of the modern technological lexicon, yet its ubiquity masks a profound act of abstraction. Etymologically, the term emerged in the context of early mainframe computing to describe the trained personnel who interacted with the machines.23 Its use became widespread with the advent of multi-user systems, where a distinction was necessary between the organization that was the 'customer' or 'owner' of the expensive hardware and the many individuals who were its 'users'.24

The academic field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) institutionalized the 'user' as a central, yet abstracted, component in its models of analysis.18 HCI research focuses on understanding the 'user's' needs, goals, and cognitive processes to enhance the usability, efficiency, and satisfaction of a system—goals that are ultimately aligned with market success and productivity.26

Critically, the term 'user' performs a decontextualization of the human being. It reduces a whole person—a complex individual embedded in social, political, and emotional realities—to a single, narrow function: their interaction with a product or system.27 This framing aligns perfectly with the logic of consumption. This reductionist quality has been critiqued by foundational figures in the field, such as Don Norman, who coined the term "user experience" but later expressed regret, advocating for "calling people people" to re-center their full humanity.28 Furthermore, the term carries negative connotations from other domains, most notably its association with narcotics ("drug user"), which implies dependency, addiction, and a one-sided, often harmful, relationship.27 This linguistic choice frames the relationship between person and technology not as one of empowerment or partnership, but as one of consumption and potential dependency.

### **Hierarchies of Power and Property: 'Owner', 'Developer', 'Maintainer'**

The language of technology is structured by concepts of property and hierarchical control, which are most evident in the roles assigned to its creators and managers.

The concept of the **'owner'** is central. In agile methodologies like Scrum, the 'Product Owner' is defined as the "sole person responsible" for the product backlog, acting as the ultimate arbiter of value and the voice of the client.31 This role centralizes decision-making power. In the context of source code, 'code ownership' signifies formal or informal control over modifications.33 Even in the seemingly collaborative world of open source, 'ownership' is a well-defined concept: it is the community-recognized, exclusive right to distribute official, modified versions of the software. This right can be acquired by founding a project, having it formally transferred ('passing the baton'), or claiming an abandoned project through a set of established customs.34 In all these contexts, the language of 'ownership' applies a logic of private property and exclusive control to what is often an infinitely reproducible, non-rivalrous digital good.

The roles of **'developer'** and **'engineer'** establish a professional identity within this hierarchy. The term 'developer' has roots in 19th-century photography and real estate, fields concerned with bringing forth or realizing latent value from a raw material.35 The title 'software engineer' emerged in the 1960s as a deliberate effort to lend the craft of programming an air of scientific legitimacy, rigor, and a systematic, disciplined process.36 While this professionalized the field, it also fostered a dynamic where a developer's identity becomes deeply fused with the code they produce, making objective criticism of the work feel like a personal attack.37 This complex identity exists within a clear hierarchy of roles, from 'Intern' and 'Junior Developer' to 'Principal Engineer', 'Architect', and 'CTO', creating a finely graded structure of authority and status.38

The **'maintainer'**, a role most prominent in open source, functions as a custodian of a project. While this implies a sense of care, it is still framed within the logic of ownership, as the maintainer is the gatekeeper of the "official" version of the code, deciding which contributions are accepted and which are rejected.

### **Mechanisms of Production and Exchange: 'Producer/Consumer', 'Client/Server'**

The relationships between different parts of a technological system are frequently described using metaphors drawn directly from market economics. The 'producer/consumer' model is a foundational binary in distributed systems and data pipelines. One entity, the 'producer', creates data or a service, which is then used by another entity, the 'consumer'. This language frames the interaction as a one-way, transactional flow of value.

This logic is mirrored in the 'client/server' architecture, one of the most fundamental models in networking and software design.39 The 'client' is a dependent entity that makes requests, while the 'server' is a centralized, powerful entity that holds resources and provides services in response. This model is not merely a technical description; it naturalizes a relationship of dependency and centralized authority. The entire ecosystem of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) is built on this request-response model, structuring the digital world as a series of transactional exchanges between clients and servers.40

This transactional logic permeates not just technical architecture but also development methodologies. Agile and Scrum frameworks are explicitly organized around the goal of delivering "value" to a 'customer', who is represented by the 'Product Owner'.41 This framing reduces the complex, multifaceted impact of technology to a single dimension of market-oriented value, obscuring other forms of value such as social connection, ecological well-being, or knowledge commons. It perpetuates a model of one-way value flow, masking the often-extractive nature of digital platforms where the 'consumer' is simultaneously producing valuable data for the 'producer'.

### **Systemic Metaphors of Domination: 'Master/Slave', 'Blacklist/Whitelist'**

While the entire lexicon is imbued with a logic of control, certain terms express this ideology in its most acute and visible form. These are not anomalies but rather the starkest revelations of the system's underlying principles.

The **'master/slave'** metaphor has been used to describe a hierarchical architecture where one process or device (the master) has unilateral control over one or more others (the slaves).43 Its technical origins can be traced to early 20th-century horology and were later adopted in electronics, databases, and computer peripherals.44 The term became a subject of controversy in the early 2000s due to its direct and painful evocation of chattel slavery.45 Following years of debate and activism, this terminology has been widely deprecated and replaced with alternatives like 'primary/secondary', 'leader/follower', 'controller/worker', or 'primary/replica'.46

Similarly, the terms **'blacklist'** and **'whitelist'** have been used for access control mechanisms that either deny or permit access to a system.48 The etymology of these terms is rooted in 17th-century labor practices and carries strong racial connotations, where 'black' is associated with exclusion, danger, and undesirability, and 'white' is associated with permission, safety, and purity.48 This negative association is reinforced by other common phrases like 'black market' and 'black sheep'.48 Recognizing these harmful undertones, the technology industry has largely moved toward more descriptive and neutral alternatives such as 'denylist/allowlist' or 'blocklist/safelist'.48

The significance of these terms lies not just in their individual offensiveness, but in what they reveal about the broader linguistic system. They are the most explicit expressions of the hierarchical, exclusionary, and dominative logic that subtly underpins more "neutral" terms like 'owner', 'client', and 'user'. They expose the latent ideologies of the entire lexicon in their most undeniable form.

To systematize this analysis, the following table maps the core terms of the current lexicon to the capitalist ideologies they help to naturalize and reproduce.

| Term | Conventional Definition | Embedded Capitalist Ideology |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **User** | The individual who interacts with a system or product.25 | **Commodification of the Person:** Reduces human beings to their function as consumers of a product, abstracting them from their social context. |
| **Owner** | The individual or group with control over code or product decisions.33 | **Primacy of Private Property & Control:** Naturalizes the concept that software, an infinitely reproducible good, can be "owned" and controlled, reinforcing hierarchies. |
| **Developer** | An individual who writes computer software.35 | **Alienation of Labor:** Separates the act of creation from the social context of its use, framing it as a technical, value-neutral skill for hire. |
| **Producer/Consumer** | The creator of a service and the entity that uses it. | **Transactional Logic:** Frames all interaction as a market-based exchange, obscuring non-commercial forms of value creation and collaboration. |
| **Master/Slave** | A hierarchical architecture where one process has unilateral control over another.43 | **Legitimation of Domination:** Normalizes extreme power asymmetry and relationships of absolute control, drawing on violent historical precedent. |
| **Blacklist/Whitelist** | A mechanism for denying or permitting access.48 | **Inherent Bias & Othering:** Encodes a value system where exclusion is the default and permission is the exception, often with racialized undertones. |

The terms within this lexicon do not exist in isolation; they form a self-reinforcing system. This linguistic structure functions as a closed feedback loop that mirrors and perpetuates the economic structure of capital.22 For example, the concept of a 'Product Owner' exists to define a vision for the 'development team'.32 The team's labor produces a product intended for an 'end-user'.51 The success of this product is then measured by metrics of 'user' engagement or satisfaction, which in turn generate profit or value that accrues to the 'owner'.52 Each term gives meaning and necessity to the others, creating a stable but rigid linguistic system that resists fundamental change.

Furthermore, the proliferation of specialized technical jargon serves as more than mere professional shorthand; it functions as a "jargon wall," a powerful gatekeeping mechanism.53 This specialized vocabulary creates a clear in-group of "technical" experts and an out-group of "non-technical" people, who are often synonymous with the 'users'.55 This mystification of technology reinforces the power of the expert class. In doing so, it ensures that crucial decisions about technological design and governance are confined to a small group, effectively excluding the broader community from participation. This linguistic practice aligns with a technocratic worldview, settling the question of who controls technology in favor of a technical elite and reinforcing the power relations identified by Critical Discourse Analysis.21

## **Part II: Deconstructing the Technical Code: A Critical Interrogation (The Antithesis)**

Having established the current technological lexicon as a coherent system reflecting capitalist ideology, this section functions as the *Antithesis*. It applies the Socratic method of relentless questioning through the lenses of several critical theories to dismantle the lexicon's facade of neutrality. Each analysis asks: What are the unexamined assumptions behind these terms? What power dynamics and contradictions do they conceal?

### **Critical Theory of Technology: Language as Instrumentalization**

Andrew Feenberg's Critical Theory of Technology (CTT) provides a powerful framework for understanding how values are embedded in technical systems.17 CTT posits that technology is not neutral but is a site of social struggle, and its language is a key terrain of that struggle.56 Feenberg's instrumentalization theory, which analyzes technology at two levels, is particularly illuminating.17

The first level, **primary instrumentalization**, involves a process of "de-worlding" or "decontextualizing" objects to reduce them to their useful properties.58 The term 'user' is a quintessential example of this process applied to human beings. It strips a person of their rich social context, their history, their emotions, and their political agency, reducing them to a set of predictable functions, needs, and behaviors that can be analyzed, modeled, and manipulated by a system.

The second level, **secondary instrumentalization**, involves re-integrating these simplified elements into a new social and technical context. This is where the "technical code"—the set of social and economic biases—is inscribed into the design.17 The language of roles such as 'developer', 'product owner', and 'QA engineer' reflects this secondary level. These roles organize the de-worlded functions of human labor into a corporate hierarchy that is fundamentally biased by the power of capital and the goal of profit maximization.59 The language itself becomes an instrument for reproducing the rule of the few over the many.

### **Science & Technology Studies (STS): Language as a Political Artifact**

Science and Technology Studies (STS) argues that technology is socially constructed and that technical artifacts are never politically neutral.60 Drawing on the work of Langdon Winner, technical terms themselves can be understood as "inherently political technologies".62 They are not merely descriptive labels but artifacts that embody and enforce social relations. For example, the 'client/server' model is not just a neutral technical description; it is an architecture that is "strongly compatible" with a political relationship of centralized authority and resource dependency, making alternatives like peer-to-peer networking appear less "natural" or "efficient".63

Donna Haraway's "A Cyborg Manifesto" offers another powerful STS lens for critique.64 Haraway attacks the "antagonistic dualisms" that structure Western thought: human/animal, organism/machine, culture/nature, male/female.65 The technological lexicon is rife with these rigid binaries: user/developer, client/server, frontend/backend, physical/non-physical. The cyborg, as a hybrid of organism and machine, is a metaphor for breaking down these boundaries and embracing partial, fluid, and ironic identities.67 A cyborg ontology would reject the clean separation between the 'user' and the 'developer', recognizing that people are co-constituted with and through their technologies.

### **Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA): Unmasking Ideology in Code and Conversation**

Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) provides a methodology for systematically analyzing the relationship between language, power, and ideology.21 Using Norman Fairclough's three-dimensional framework, we can deconstruct the technological lexicon as a social practice.20

1. **Text:** At the level of the text, we can analyze the metaphors that frame technical concepts. Terms like 'bug' and 'glitch' frame software flaws as quasi-natural phenomena, like insects or electrical faults, that are discovered rather than created. This obscures the human decisions, trade-offs, and labor conditions that lead to errors. Similarly, the term 'technical debt' frames the consequences of poor design choices as a financial instrument, a rational and manageable liability, rather than a source of ongoing frustration and uncompensated labor for future developers.
2. **Discourse Practice:** At the level of discourse practice, we can examine how language is used in specific contexts, such as agile software development. The vocabulary of agile—'sprints', 'velocity', 'burndown charts'—constitutes a discourse that prioritizes speed, quantifiable output, and a relentless forward momentum. This language, used in daily 'stand-up' meetings, reinforces cultural norms of efficiency and productivity, often at the expense of deep reflection, deliberation, or worker well-being.69
3. **Social Practice:** At the broadest level, CDA connects this discourse to the reproduction of wider social structures.70 The language of technology, with its emphasis on individual roles, quantifiable performance, and transactional value, is a powerful mechanism for reproducing capitalist labor relations and a technocratic worldview within the workplace.

### **Decolonial and Posthumanist Ruptures: Beyond the Western, Human-Centric Subject**

A deeper critique reveals that the technological lexicon is not only capitalist but also colonial and anthropocentric in its assumptions.

The **decolonial critique** argues that the lexicon is embedded in a colonial matrix of power.71 The 'master/slave' metaphor is the most overt manifestation, but the logic runs deeper. Decolonial computing challenges the universalist, objective claims of computer science, arguing that they are rooted in Western, Global North epistemologies.72 The very act of abstracting, categorizing, and naming—creating 'users' from people, 'data' from lived experience—can be an act of "epistemic violence," imposing a Western, quantitative framework onto diverse global cultures and ways of knowing.73 The dominance of English as the lingua franca of programming languages, documentation, and technical discourse is another layer of this linguistic colonialism, marginalizing non-English speakers and reinforcing global power imbalances.74

The **posthumanist critique**, drawing from the "more-than-human turn" in HCI, challenges the anthropocentrism of the entire framework, which is epitomized by the term 'user'.75 This term establishes the human as the center and purpose of the technological universe, framing the relationship as one of utility, where the non-human world (from algorithms to ecosystems) is merely a resource to be used. A posthumanist perspective calls for a language that acknowledges our entanglement within vast socio-technical and ecological systems, recognizing the agency of non-human actors and shifting the focus from human-centered utility to symbiotic co-existence.

The corporate-led "inclusive language" movement, which focuses on replacing terms like 'master/slave' and 'blacklist/whitelist', can be understood as a form of ideological inoculation.76 By addressing the most visibly egregious and morally indefensible terms, the underlying system protects its core ideological assumptions—those embedded in seemingly neutral terms like 'user', 'owner', and 'client'—from a more profound and structural critique. The system sacrifices easily replaceable terms that generate significant controversy to preserve the structurally essential terms that quietly reproduce its logic. While the move away from overtly racist language is a positive and necessary step, it can have the unintended effect of neutralizing the momentum for a more radical and systemic linguistic transformation, functioning as a "regrettable substitution" that changes the symbol without altering the substance of the underlying power dynamic.78

Within this system, the identity of the 'developer' is fraught with a fundamental contradiction. On one hand, the language of the profession elevates them to the status of powerful, creative 'engineers' and 'architects', a status adopted historically to grant legitimacy and professional pride.36 This fosters a sense of psychological ownership and deep personal investment in their work.37 On the other hand, the legal and economic reality of their employment is one of work-for-hire, where corporeal ownership and ultimate control rest with the corporation or 'product owner'.33 This creates a dialectical tension: the developer is simultaneously positioned as a creative master of their craft and a wage laborer alienated from the final product of their labor. This unresolved conflict is a direct reflection of the classic struggle between labor and capital, played out at the level of professional identity, language, and the very code they create.

## **Part III: A New Lexicon for a New World: Principles for a Post-Capitalist Technological Ontology (The Synthesis)**

This final section presents the *Synthesis* of the dialectical analysis. Moving beyond deconstruction, it proposes a new linguistic framework for technology grounded in post-capitalist principles. These principles include the creation of new social relationships, a shift from ownership to sharing, the building of community economies, and strategies of degrowth.79 The goal is not to create a fixed, one-to-one replacement for every term, but to shift the underlying metaphors from those of control, extraction, and hierarchy to those of care, collaboration, and symbiosis.81 This new ontology is guided by values of commoning, sustainability, democratic governance, and a de-emphasis on profit maximization.82

### **From Users to Participants, Co-Creators, and Inhabitants**

The most fundamental shift required is moving away from the passive, consumptive, and objectifying term 'user'. The proposed alternatives aim to restore agency, context, and a sense of active involvement.

* **'Participant' / 'Co-creator'**: These terms reframe the relationship from passive consumption to active collaboration. They emphasize that the people interacting with a system are not merely recipients of its effects but are actively involved in its operation, evaluation, and evolution. This language aligns with the principles of participatory design and the democratic ideal of "no innovation without representation," where those affected by a technology have a voice in its creation.15
* **'Inhabitant'**: This term, drawn from a posthumanist perspective, repositions people as living *within* complex socio-technical and ecological systems, rather than simply 'using' a discrete product. It acknowledges long-term entanglement and interdependence with both technology and the environment, fostering a sense of place and responsibility rather than transient utility.
* **'People'**: As advocated by Don Norman, this remains the simplest and most powerful alternative.28 It resists abstraction and re-centers the whole, complex human being at the heart of any technological consideration.

### **From Ownership to Stewardship, Custodianship, and Commoning**

To counter the ideology of private property and hierarchical control, the new lexicon should adopt language that reflects collective care and shared responsibility.

* **'Steward' / 'Custodian'**: These terms replace 'owner' and 'maintainer'. A steward or custodian does not possess an absolute right of control for personal gain but holds a duty of care to a resource on behalf of a community.34 This framing is more aligned with the ethos of many open-source projects and the broader principles of managing a commons.81
* **'Contributor' / 'Committer'**: Already prevalent in open-source communities, these terms should be elevated. They describe roles based on action and contribution rather than on a static, hierarchical status. They emphasize what a person *does* rather than what they *are*.
* **'Facilitator' / 'Coordinator'**: As alternatives to 'manager' or 'Product Owner', these terms shift the role from one of command and direction to one of enabling and supporting a team's collaborative work. This language fosters more democratic and horizontal forms of governance within a project.82

### **Relational Ontologies: Symbiosis, Inter-being, and Federation**

The new lexicon must replace the transactional and dominative metaphors for system relationships ('client/server', 'master/slave') with metaphors drawn from ecology and democratic politics.

* **'Peer' / 'Partner'**: For distributed systems, these terms describe a relationship between equals in a federated network, replacing the inherent hierarchy of 'client/server'.
* **'Prosumer' / 'Peer Producer'**: As a replacement for the 'producer/consumer' binary, these terms acknowledge the dual role that participants play in many digital ecosystems, particularly in commons-based peer production, where they are simultaneously creating and consuming value.83
* **'Conductor/Instrument' or 'Coordinator/Participant'**: As alternatives for control relationships like 'controller/device', these metaphors shift the framing from unilateral command to orchestration, guidance, or collaborative action.

### **A Manifesto for a Future-Forward Language**

The development of a new technological language must be an ongoing, conscious, and collective process. The following principles, inspired by manifestos for ethical technology, can guide this effort.84

1. **Principle of Agency:** Language should empower, not objectify. It should describe people and other actors as active participants with agency, not as passive objects to be managed or controlled.
2. **Principle of Plurality:** Language should embrace diversity and reject false universalisms. It must be sensitive to cultural context and avoid imposing a single, dominant worldview.
3. **Principle of Interconnection:** Language should reflect ecological and systemic relationships, not isolated components. It should highlight interdependence and mutual influence, rather than linear cause-and-effect.
4. **Principle of Care:** Language should foster stewardship, responsibility, and maintenance, not extraction, control, and disposal. It should value the long-term health of the community and the system over short-term gains.
5. **Principle of Provisionality:** Language is a living system. This lexicon is not a final decree but a starting point for an ongoing, democratic conversation about the words we use and the worlds we build with them.

The following comparative glossary provides a practical synthesis of this report's analysis, offering concrete alternatives and their rationales.

| Problematic Term | Summary of Critique | Proposed Alternatives & Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **User** | Reduces people to a consumptive function; decontextualizes and objectifies them (Feenberg's "de-worlding").17 | **People, Participant, Inhabitant, Co-creator.** Rationale: Re-centers the whole person, emphasizes active agency, and acknowledges entanglement in socio-technical systems.28 |
| **Owner** | Reinforces capitalist notions of private property and hierarchical control over infinitely reproducible goods.32 | **Steward, Custodian, Maintainer.** Rationale: Shifts metaphor from control and exclusion to care, responsibility, and service to a community or commons.34 |
| **Developer/Engineer** | Creates a professional identity alienated from the social product of labor and fosters an unhealthy attachment of self to code.37 | **Crafter, Builder, Contributor.** Rationale: Emphasizes the act of making and contribution over a professionalized, hierarchical status. Reconnects the work to a tangible practice. |
| **Client/Server** | Establishes a binary, transactional relationship of request and provision, mirroring market logic.39 | **Peer/Peer, Requester/Responder, Service/Participant.** Rationale: Flattens hierarchy and describes the technical function without embedding a social or economic power dynamic. |
| **Master/Slave** | Normalizes a metaphor of absolute domination with violent historical and racial connotations.43 | **Primary/Replica, Controller/Worker, Leader/Follower.** Rationale: Uses more descriptive, less socially-loaded terms to describe the technical relationship of control, coordination, or replication.47 |

## **Conclusion: Language as a Lever for Transformation**

This report has undertaken a dialectical journey through the language of technology. It began by mapping the existing lexicon as a coherent system that reflects and reinforces the ideologies of capitalism (the *Thesis*). It then subjected this lexicon to a multi-pronged critical deconstruction, employing tools from CTT, STS, CDA, and decolonial theory to expose its hidden assumptions and contradictions (the *Antithesis*). Finally, it has proposed the beginnings of a new linguistic framework grounded in post-capitalist values of collaboration, commoning, and care (the *Synthesis*).

The analysis concludes that language is not an ornamental or secondary aspect of technology but is foundational to its design, its implementation, and its social effects. The words we choose are not mere labels; they are instruments that shape thought, structure relationships, and limit or expand our imaginative horizons.

To consciously choose to speak of 'participants' instead of 'users', of 'stewards' instead of 'owners', or of 'peers' instead of 'clients' is a powerful political act. It is an act of refusal against a linguistic framework that objectifies people and naturalizes exploitation. It is an act of creation that opens up new conceptual space. This shift changes how we think about our relationship to technology, how we relate to each other in the process of building it, and ultimately, what kind of technology we are capable of imagining and creating. Changing our language is a critical and accessible first step in the "democratic transformation" of technology.58 It is a necessary prerequisite for building socio-technical systems that genuinely serve the goals of social equity, ecological sustainability, and collective well-being, rather than the singular pursuit of relentless accumulation and profit.
