# **From Code to Context: A Critical Evaluation of Holistic Paradigms for LLM Software Comprehension**

## **Part I: The Thesis \- The Software Lifecycle as a Unified Knowledge Graph**

The pursuit of artificial intelligence capable of genuine code comprehension necessitates moving beyond the superficial pattern-matching of raw text. The first major paradigm in this endeavor posits that deep understanding can be achieved by treating the entire software project—not just its code, but its requirements, designs, tests, and documentation—as a single, interconnected, and machine-queryable knowledge artifact. This approach, rooted in systems thinking and program analysis, prioritizes the explicit representation of structure, relationships, and verifiable facts across the entire development lifecycle. It seeks to build a comprehensive "digital twin" of the software project, which can then be used to guide a Large Language Model's (LLM) reasoning processes. This section establishes this thesis by deconstructing the various software artifacts into their fundamental machine-interpretable components, detailing the construction of a holistic Knowledge Graph (KG) from these components, and evaluating how this unified KG can ground LLMs to produce more accurate and context-aware outputs.

### **Section 1: Foundations of Machine-Interpretable Software Artifacts**

To enable machines to "understand" a software system, its constituent artifacts must first be transformed from ambiguous formats into structured, interconnected representations. This process of abstraction is foundational to all modern comprehension techniques. The evolution of these representations reveals a clear trajectory from capturing pure code syntax to modeling complex semantic relationships across the entire software lifecycle, culminating in rich, multi-modal graphs that serve as the building blocks for a truly holistic knowledge system.

#### **Code Representations: From Syntax to Semantics**

The journey begins with source code, which must be parsed into structured formats.

* **Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs):** The most fundamental step is parsing code into an AST, a hierarchical representation of its syntactic structure.1 By abstracting away irrelevant details like comments and whitespace, the AST focuses on the code's logical organization, making it more intelligible to models for tasks like code translation and robust, "surgical" code merging.3 Tools like tree-sitter are commonly used to perform this initial parsing.4  
* **Control and Data Flow Graphs (CFGs & DFGs):** While an AST captures static structure, a Control Flow Graph (CFG) models the program's execution paths, and a Data Flow Graph (DFG) tracks how data propagates through the code.1 A DFG connects variable definitions to their uses, creating "definition-use chains" that are crucial for understanding the semantic impact of code.2  
* **Synthesized Code Graphs (CPGs & SCGs):** The true power of these representations is realized when they are combined. The Code Property Graph (CPG) and Semantic Code Graph (SCG) integrate ASTs, CFGs, and DFGs into a unified structure.2 This allows an analysis engine to collectively reason about syntax, control flow, and data dependencies within a single graph, enabling deeper analytical insights and the discovery of complex properties like excessive variable usage or functionally similar methods.2

#### **Behavioral Specifications as Data: Gherkin**

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) provides another machine-readable artifact in the form of Gherkin feature files. Gherkin uses a structured, keyword-driven syntax (Feature, Rule, Scenario, Given, When, Then) to describe system behavior in a human-readable format that is also parsable by automation tools.32 Because each scenario is meant to cover a single, distinct behavior, its structure is ideal for transformation into a knowledge graph.33 A parser can transform a .feature file into a subgraph containing Feature, Rule, and Scenario nodes, with each step (Given, When, Then) becoming a node linked in sequence.34 This creates a direct, graphable link between a high-level business rule and the specific, testable behavior that validates it.

#### **Design and Architecture as Code**

The "Diagrams as Code" paradigm allows architectural and design diagrams, which are traditionally created in visual editors, to be defined in a version-controllable text format.35 Tools like **PlantUML**, **Mermaid**, and **Structurizr** use markup languages to define UML diagrams, C4 models, sequence diagrams, and more. This textual representation is machine-readable and can be parsed to create Diagram, Component, and Relationship nodes within the KG, explicitly linking the high-level system design to the code components that implement it.28

#### **Formal Methods as Graphable Logic**

Formal specifications and proofs, used to mathematically verify that a program behaves as intended, can also be integrated.36 These artifacts are written in special-purpose formal languages that capture logical relationships.36 The underlying knowledge representation formalisms, such as Description Logics (DLs), map naturally to graph structures.37 A formal specification can be decomposed into a set of logical axioms and rules that are represented as nodes and edges in the graph, allowing for deductive reasoning and automated consistency checks.37

| Artifact Type | Representation | Key Information Captured | Graph Node Examples |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Source Code** | CPG / SCG | Syntax, control flow, data flow, dependencies | Class, Function, Variable |
| **Requirements** | Natural Language | Business needs, functional/non-functional specs | Requirement, BusinessRule |
| **Design** | Diagrams as Code | System components, containers, relationships | Component, Interface, SequenceDiagram |
| **Behavioral Tests** | Gherkin | User scenarios, acceptance criteria, business rules | Feature, Rule, Scenario, Step |
| **Formal Methods** | Logical Formalisms | Mathematical specifications, proofs, constraints | Precondition, Postcondition, Proof |

### **Section 2: The Unified Software Knowledge Graph: A Digital Twin of the Lifecycle**

A truly comprehensive understanding of a software system requires moving beyond a code-only view to create a holistic model of the entire development lifecycle. By integrating all software artifacts—from initial requirements to final implementation—into a single, unified Knowledge Graph (KG), we can construct a "digital twin" of the project. This provides a 360-degree, panoramic view that connects the *why* (requirements, design rationale) with the *what* (code) and the *how* (tests, diagrams).

#### **Defining the Unified Software KG**

A unified software KG is a living, graph-structured representation that models entities from every stage of the software lifecycle as nodes and the relationships between them as edges.39 This goes far beyond a simple code graph by creating a cohesive view that amalgamates diverse and previously siloed data sources.

#### **Ontology: The Blueprint for Holistic Representation**

The foundation of this unified KG is a well-defined ontology—a formal schema that defines the types of entities, their properties, and the rules governing their relationships.40 A comprehensive software lifecycle ontology would include:

* **Node Types:** In addition to code entities (Module, Class, Function), the schema must define nodes for all other artifacts, such as Requirement, Specification, DesignDiagram, DiagramComponent, GherkinFeature, GherkinScenario, and FormalProof.42  
* **Relationship Types:** The power of the unified graph comes from its rich set of relationships that create traceability across artifacts. These edges capture the semantics of the development process itself: a Requirement is REFINED\_INTO a Specification, which is IMPLEMENTED\_BY a Function, which is TESTED\_BY a GherkinScenario, and VISUALIZED\_IN a DesignDiagram.

#### **The Unified KG Construction Pipeline**

Building this digital twin is a multi-stage process that transforms heterogeneous artifacts into a structured, queryable database.

1. **Multi-Modal Ingestion:** The pipeline begins by parsing all artifacts using specialized tools: static analyzers for code, "Diagrams as Code" parsers for architecture, Gherkin parsers for test scenarios, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines to extract entities and relationships from unstructured documents like requirements and specifications.  
2. **Graph Construction:** The extracted entities and relationships are ingested into a graph database like Neo4j.45 This creates a single, cohesive data landscape from previously disconnected information silos.  
3. **Traceability Link Recovery (TLR):** A critical step is automatically discovering and creating the traceability links that connect the different artifacts. Modern TLR techniques use neural networks to learn the semantic similarity between artifacts, for example, by linking a natural language requirement to the code comments of the function that implements it. Tools like **TransArC** create transitive links from architecture documentation to models and then to code, bridging the gap between high-level design and implementation.

The result is a powerful, unified data model that enables a new level of system intelligence. Tasks that were once impossible now become straightforward queries. For example, one could ask, "Show me all functions that implement business rule BR-123, the requirements they trace back to, the Gherkin tests that verify them, and who last modified them." This end-to-end traceability is invaluable for impact analysis, compliance, and system maintenance.

### **Section 3: Grounding LLMs with Graph-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG)**

While a unified Knowledge Graph provides a powerful, static representation of a software project, its true potential is unlocked when paired with a Large Language Model. The KG serves as an external, structured "brain" that can ground the LLM's reasoning, mitigating its inherent weaknesses—such as hallucination and a lack of domain-specific knowledge—and enabling a more sophisticated level of comprehension.17 This synergy is most effectively realized through Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG).

The GraphRAG process connects the LLM to the unified KG as a dynamic, external knowledge base.17 When a user poses a query, the system executes a formal, deterministic traversal of the graph to retrieve a relevant subgraph.12 This subgraph, containing a collection of structured facts from across the software lifecycle, is then linearized and prepended to the user's query as context for the LLM.14

This mechanism fundamentally transforms the LLM's role from that of a "knower" to that of a "reasoner." With the unified KG, the context provided is exceptionally rich. A query like, "How would changing the authentication API affect our compliance with security requirement SR-42?" would trigger a multi-hop graph traversal that retrieves not just the API's code and its downstream dependencies, but also the Requirement node for SR-42, the GherkinScenario nodes that test it, and the DesignDiagram nodes that illustrate its place in the architecture. The LLM's task is no longer to recall an answer from its internal, often unreliable memory, but to synthesize a coherent explanation based on a rich, multi-faceted, and verifiable set of ground-truth data. This creates a system that is more accurate, auditable, and easily kept up-to-date.16

### **Section 4: The Multi-View Paradigm: Artifacts as Transformations and Traceability Links**

Viewing the various software artifacts as transformations of one another provides a powerful conceptual lens for understanding the unified KG. This perspective aligns with research into **Multi-View Knowledge Graphs**, which learn a comprehensive representation of an entity by unifying its different "views" or modalities.47 In this paradigm, a single abstract software concept (e.g., "user authentication") has multiple concrete representations: a requirement\_view (the specification text), a design\_view (a component diagram), a code\_view (the AST of the implementing class), and a test\_view (the Gherkin scenarios).47

The relationships connecting these views are the **traceability links** that form the backbone of the software development lifecycle. These links are not merely pointers; they represent the transformations that occur as an idea moves from conception to implementation. A requirement is *transformed* into a design, which is *transformed* into code, which is *validated by* a test.

Modeling the lifecycle this way within the KG unlocks several key capabilities:

* **Automated Consistency Checking:** The graph can enforce rules about these transformations. If a Function node is modified (detected via version control integration), the KG can automatically flag its associated GherkinScenario and Documentation nodes as potentially stale, creating a self-validating system that helps maintain architectural integrity.40  
* **Deep Impact Analysis:** Traceability links allow for precise impact analysis. Before changing a requirement, a query can traverse the graph to identify every downstream artifact—designs, code, tests, documentation—that will be affected, providing a complete picture of the change's ripple effects.  
* **Enhanced AI Reasoning:** For an LLM agent, this multi-view representation provides a much richer context. The agent can reason across different levels of abstraction, leveraging the design view for architectural context, the requirement view for intent, and the code view for implementation details, leading to more robust and informed decision-making.

## **Part II: The Antithesis \- Code as a Dynamic, Executable Process**

The thesis that comprehension can be achieved through a holistic, static knowledge representation, while powerful, rests on the assumption that a sufficiently detailed map of the software lifecycle is equivalent to understanding the code's purpose and behavior. The antithesis to this view argues that true comprehension cannot be derived from static structures alone. Instead, it must be learned from the code's dynamic properties—its behavior during execution, its effect on a computational environment, and its semantic consequences. This section presents this contrasting paradigm, first by critically examining the inherent limitations of static analysis and then by introducing Meta's Code World Model (CWM) as the prime exemplar of a new approach focused on learning an internal, predictive model of code execution.

### **Section 5: The Inherent Limits of Static Representation**

Despite the sophistication of unified software KGs, systems built solely on static analysis exhibit fundamental limitations that reveal a "shallow" form of understanding. Empirical research demonstrates that while LLMs can generate syntactically correct and plausible code, their reasoning is often not rooted in a deep, functional model of the program's semantics. This shallowness is most starkly revealed by their fragility in the face of changes that are semantically irrelevant but textually distinct.

#### **The "Shallow Understanding" Problem**

Multiple studies have concluded that LLM code comprehension remains heavily tied to lexical and syntactic features rather than abstract, functional logic.19 Models often rely on non-functional cues, such as the names of variables and functions or the content of comments, to make inferences about a program's behavior.19 This reliance on surface-level patterns means the model's "understanding" is brittle and can be easily misled.

#### **Brittleness to Semantic-Preserving Mutations (SPMs)**

The most compelling evidence for this shallow understanding comes from experiments involving Semantic-Preserving Mutations (SPMs). SPMs are changes made to a program's source code that do not alter its underlying functionality or behavior in any way.19 Examples include renaming a variable, adding a misleading comment, or inserting unreachable "dead code".19 A model with a deep, semantic understanding of code should be entirely insensitive to such changes. However, research demonstrates the opposite. In one large-scale study, LLMs that initially succeeded at a debugging task failed on the same task in 81% of cases after SPMs were applied to the code.19 This extreme sensitivity provides strong evidence that the models are not reasoning about the code's behavior but are instead relying on a fragile form of pattern recognition.20

#### **The Gap Between Structure and Execution**

This fragility exposes the core limitation of any purely static approach, including the unified KG paradigm. A Knowledge Graph, no matter how holistic, represents the *potential* for execution; it is a blueprint of the system's design, not a model of the system's execution itself. It can show that a requirement is implemented by function A, which calls function B, but it cannot intrinsically represent the state of the program's memory before and after that call, nor can it capture emergent behaviors that only manifest at runtime. This implies that providing a better static map may not be sufficient. To develop a more robust and genuine form of comprehension, the model must learn from the "building in use"—the dynamic, runtime behavior of the code.

### **Section 6: Meta's Code World Model (CWM): A New Frontier**

In direct response to the limitations of static analysis, Meta has introduced the Code World Model (CWM), a paradigm-shifting LLM designed to learn an internal, predictive model of code execution.49 The revolutionary promise of CWM is to move beyond matching the patterns of static code and instead model the *execution world* of the code itself.24 It achieves this by learning not just from finished source code, but from vast quantities of "observe-act-observe" trajectories that capture the dynamic state changes that occur as programs run.50

#### **CWM Architecture and Training**

At its core, CWM is a 32-billion-parameter, dense, decoder-only Transformer model with a large context window of up to 131,000 tokens.22 Its defining innovation lies in its unique, three-stage training pipeline:

1. **Pre-training:** CWM was trained on 8 trillion tokens of data (30% code, 70% general text) to build foundational programming and language knowledge.24  
2. **Mid-training:** This is the crucial "world modeling" phase, where the model is trained for an additional 5 trillion tokens on specialized execution trajectories. This data includes \~200 million Python memory traces capturing step-by-step execution and \~3 million agentic trajectories from AI agents solving coding tasks in Docker environments.24  
3. **Post-training:** The model is refined for specific tasks through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), where it receives rewards for successful outcomes like passing unit tests.24

This training process forces the model to build an intuitive "physics engine" for code. By learning to predict the next state of a program's memory given the current state and a line of code, the LLM is not merely memorizing syntax; it is learning the *semantic effect* of that syntax on a computational environment.51 This is a much deeper level of understanding than that offered by a static KG, which can only represent the code as a node with fixed properties. CWM learns a *function* that transforms state, building an internal model of computation itself.

### **Section 7: CWM in Practice: Simulation, Agency, and Performance**

The theoretical advantages of CWM's dynamic training paradigm are substantiated by its practical capabilities and its exceptional performance on a range of difficult industry benchmarks.

#### **Demonstrated Capabilities**

The "world model" trained into CWM manifests as several concrete, advanced capabilities:

* **Execution Simulation:** CWM can perform a step-by-step "mental simulation" of Python code execution, predicting how program state changes line by line.21  
* **Agentic Coding:** The model shows strong potential for acting as an autonomous agent to solve complex software engineering problems by planning and executing a sequence of actions (write code, run tests, debug) within a computational environment.21  
* **General World Modeling:** The underlying concept is not limited to code. Other research has shown that this approach can be applied to different domains, such as translating the natural language rules of a board game into a formal, executable Python model that can then be used by planning algorithms.52

#### **Benchmark Performance**

CWM's effectiveness is quantitatively demonstrated by its state-of-the-art performance on several challenging benchmarks:

* **SWE-bench Verified:** CWM achieves a pass@1 score of 65.8% on this benchmark, which requires resolving real-world bugs from open-source projects.49  
* **LiveCodeBench:** The model scores 68.6% on problems from live competitive programming contests.49  
* **Mathematical Reasoning:** CWM achieves a near-perfect 96.6% on Math-500 and an impressive 76.0% on the AIME 2024 problems, a high-school mathematics Olympiad that requires complex, multi-step formal reasoning.49

The model's exceptional performance on mathematical reasoning is a direct consequence of its training on code execution. There is a deep structural isomorphism between solving a formal math problem and executing a computer program. By training on millions of Python execution traces, its developers were not just teaching it "Python"; they were training it to be a general-purpose symbolic reasoning engine.

## **Part III: Synthesis \- Towards a Holistic Framework for Code Comprehension**

Having established the dialectic between the holistic, static Knowledge Graph paradigm (the thesis) and the dynamic, execution-oriented Code World Model paradigm (the antithesis), the final part of this report seeks a synthesis. A truly holistic framework for comprehension must reconcile these seemingly opposing views by combining the strengths of both.

### **Section 8: A Dialectical Synthesis: Reconciling Static and Dynamic Models**

The unified KG and CWM paradigms represent two distinct philosophies: the former prioritizes explicit, verifiable knowledge of the entire software lifecycle, while the latter prioritizes an implicit, predictive understanding of runtime behavior. A deeper analysis reveals them to be complementary, with the potential for a powerful synthesis that combines the architectural breadth of the KG with the behavioral depth of the CWM.53

This juxtaposition invites a Socratic inquiry into their potential synergy:

* **Can a KG bootstrap a World Model?** An agentic model like CWM, when faced with a large, unfamiliar project, could use the unified KG as a high-level "map" to guide its exploration. The KG could quickly provide the architectural context—identifying key requirements, critical dependencies, and relevant APIs—allowing the CWM to focus its more computationally expensive simulations on the most pertinent parts of the code.17  
* **Can a World Model enrich a KG?** The dynamic insights generated by a CWM could be used to augment and validate the static KG. For example, by simulating common usage scenarios, a CWM could identify runtime data flows or performance bottlenecks not apparent from static analysis alone. This information could then be added as new edges or properties in the KG, transforming the static "blueprint" into a living document that reflects actual usage patterns.  
* **Can Hybrid Representations Bridge the Gap?** Recent research has explored representing KGs *as code*—for instance, defining entities and relationships as Python classes—and then using this code as training data for an LLM.15 This approach leverages the LLM's natural affinity for parsing structured code to more effectively internalize the logical relationships of the graph.

This line of inquiry leads to a powerful synthesis: the ultimate system for software comprehension will likely be a hybrid "Digital Twin" of the software project. In this model, the unified KG serves as the static, structural "blueprint," providing a complete and verifiable map of the system's design and intent. The CWM component acts as the dynamic "physics simulation engine," capable of modeling the behavior of the system under various conditions. This hybrid approach combines the lifecycle-wide context and verifiability of the KG with the behavioral depth and predictive insight of the CWM, creating a far more powerful and comprehensive comprehension system than either paradigm could achieve in isolation.

| Dimension | Unified Knowledge Graph (KG) with RAG | Code World Model (CWM) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Representation Type** | Explicit, symbolic graph of all software artifacts | Implicit, sub-symbolic neural network weights |
| **Primary Reasoning Mode** | Query, retrieval, and multi-artifact graph traversal | Predictive simulation and pattern completion |
| **Handling of Dynamics** | Limited; represents static potential for execution | Core strength; models runtime state changes and behavior |
| **Verifiability** | High; retrieved facts are explicit and auditable | Low; reasoning is opaque ("black box") |
| **Update Mechanism** | Continuous; graph can be updated as artifacts change | Episodic; requires expensive retraining/fine-tuning |
| **Key Strength** | Holistic lifecycle view, verifiable facts, end-to-end traceability | Deep semantic understanding of execution, agentic planning |
| **Key Weakness** | Inability to model runtime state and emergent behavior | High computational cost, lack of explicit verifiability |

### **Section 9: A Systems-Level View of the Comprehension Ecosystem**

The KG and CWM paradigms, while central, are core components of a broader, emerging ecosystem of techniques. A systems-level perspective reveals a coherent, hierarchical "stack" for code comprehension, where each layer builds upon the one below it.

1. **Layer 1: Input Processing and Representation.** At the base is the processing of raw artifacts into machine-readable units. This includes structure-aware techniques like **Chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (CAST)** for code, as well as parsers for Gherkin, "Diagrams as Code" tools, and NLP pipelines for documentation.4  
2. **Layer 2: Knowledge Modeling and Encoding.** This layer builds the core knowledge representations. This is where the two primary paradigms reside: the construction of a static **Unified Software Knowledge Graph** and the generation of **execution trajectories** to train a dynamic **Code World Model**.16 It also includes **Code Representation Learning** techniques like contrastive learning to generate dense **vector embeddings** of artifacts, which are essential for semantic search.55  
3. **Layer 3: Context Provisioning and Retrieval.** This layer provides the core LLM with the necessary context. For the KG paradigm, this involves **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** to retrieve a relevant subgraph.14 For the CWM, it might involve setting up an initial state for a simulation.  
4. **Layer 4: Reasoning and Synthesis.** This is the "brain" of the system, where a core LLM operates on the provided context. The LLM's reasoning is guided by **Advanced Prompting Strategies** like **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** or agentic frameworks like **ReAct** (Reason+Act).25  
5. **Layer 5: Specialization and Adaptation.** At the top of the stack, the entire system can be specialized for a particular domain through **Fine-Tuning** on a company's proprietary codebase or internal documentation.58 This must be approached with caution, as fine-tuning can sometimes act as a "destructive overwrite," potentially degrading the model's general capabilities.31

This layered view demonstrates that the various methods for enhancing LLM comprehension are not competitors but are becoming integrated components of a full-stack software intelligence system.

### **Section 10: Unanswered Questions and Future Trajectories**

As the field advances, it is crucial to apply a Socratic lens to challenge its core assumptions and define the next set of fundamental questions. The progress from code-only static graphs to holistic, dynamic systems brings the limits of our current understanding into sharper focus.

#### **What is "Understanding"?**

The central, unanswered question is what we truly mean by "comprehension" for an AI agent. Current evaluation is dominated by metrics of functional correctness, such as the pass@k metric.26 However, the research on Semantic-Preserving Mutations (SPMs) strongly suggests that functional correctness is not equivalent to genuine understanding.19 A model can learn to generate statistically likely code that passes tests without possessing a deeper model of the code's intent or logic. Are we building systems that truly reason, or are we building exceptionally sophisticated mimics?

#### **The Crisis of Evaluation**

This ambiguity leads to a crisis in evaluation. Current benchmarks are susceptible to data contamination, and some code similarity metrics are heavily biased towards surface-level textual similarity rather than true functional equivalence.59 The field urgently needs new evaluation paradigms that probe for deeper reasoning, focusing on novelty, abstraction, and non-functional requirements like algorithmic complexity or security.

#### **The "Meaning Barrier" and the Path Forward**

The current paradigms are exceptionally proficient at modeling *what* the code is and *how* it executes. However, the ultimate goal is to understand the *why*. Why was this architecture chosen? What business requirement does this module fulfill? What was the programmer's *intent*? By integrating artifacts like requirements specifications, design documents, and architectural decision records into a unified KG, we are taking the first crucial steps toward breaking this "Meaning Barrier." The next major breakthrough will come from systems that can seamlessly reason across structure (code), behavior (execution), and intent (requirements and design), creating a truly holistic understanding of software.

### **Section 11: Recommendations for Research and Practice**

This critical evaluation yields a set of actionable recommendations for practitioners, researchers, and the broader AI community.

#### **For Practitioners (Software Architects and Engineering Leads)**

1. **Invest in a Unified Knowledge Graph as a Foundational Asset.** The immediate, practical value of building a KG that integrates code with requirements, tests, and documentation is immense. It provides invaluable insights into a project's architecture, dependencies, and health, powering immediate use cases like enhanced code search, impact analysis, and new developer onboarding.16  
2. **Prioritize GraphRAG for Project-Specific Q\&A.** For grounding an LLM in a specific, private project, the GraphRAG approach is currently superior to fine-tuning. RAG offers a more reliable, auditable, and cost-effective solution for knowledge injection, allowing the KG to be updated continuously as artifacts evolve without expensive model retraining.17

#### **For AI/ML Researchers**

1. **Focus on Hybrid Architectures.** The most promising path forward lies in hybrid models that integrate the strengths of static, holistic KGs and dynamic World Models. Research into novel architectures that treat the unified KG as a first-class component for agentic planning and reasoning is critical.  
2. **Develop New Frontiers in Evaluation.** The field is constrained by its metrics. A concerted effort is needed to move beyond benchmarks based on functional correctness alone. Researchers should focus on creating novel evaluation frameworks that probe for deeper semantic reasoning across the entire software lifecycle.

#### **For the Broader AI Community**

1. **Support and Contribute to Open Models and Datasets.** Progress is accelerated by collaboration and shared resources. The release of powerful open-weights models like Meta's CWM is a vital contribution, providing a common testbed for the global research community.21 Continued support for open models, open-source tooling for KG construction (including parsers for various software artifacts), and open, dynamic execution-based datasets will be essential for driving the next wave of innovation.
