# Alignment Review Process for DevSynth SDLC Artifacts

## Introduction

This document outlines the process for conducting regular reviews of alignment between Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) artifacts in the DevSynth project. Regular reviews ensure that requirements, specifications, tests, and code remain synchronized throughout the development lifecycle, reducing inconsistencies and improving overall product quality.

## Review Cycles

### Weekly Alignment Triage

**Purpose**: Quickly identify and address new alignment issues.

**Participants**: Technical lead, one developer (rotating)

**Duration**: 30 minutes

**Process**:
1. Run the alignment check tool: `devsynth align --output weekly-report.md`
2. Review new issues identified since the last triage
3. Prioritize issues based on impact and urgency
4. Assign ownership for high-priority issues
5. Document decisions in the weekly triage report

**Artifacts**:
- Weekly alignment report (generated by the tool)
- Weekly triage minutes (decisions and assignments)

### Bi-weekly Alignment Review

**Purpose**: Conduct a detailed review of alignment between artifacts for features in active development.

**Participants**: Technical lead, all developers working on the feature

**Duration**: 1 hour

**Process**:
1. Identify features in active development
2. For each feature:
   - Review requirements and their alignment with specifications
   - Review specifications and their alignment with tests
   - Review tests and their alignment with code
   - Identify any cross-cutting alignment issues
3. Document issues and assign ownership
4. Review progress on previously identified issues

**Artifacts**:
- Bi-weekly alignment review minutes
- Updated issue tracking entries for alignment issues
- Updated traceability matrix

### Monthly Comprehensive Review

**Purpose**: Conduct a full review of all artifacts and their alignment across the entire project.

**Participants**: Technical lead, product owner, all developers

**Duration**: 2 hours

**Process**:
1. Run the alignment check tool on the entire project
2. Review alignment metrics and trends
3. Identify systemic alignment issues
4. Review the effectiveness of the alignment process
5. Identify process improvements
6. Update the alignment guidelines and checklist as needed

**Artifacts**:
- Monthly alignment report
- Process improvement suggestions
- Updated alignment guidelines and checklist (if needed)
- Updated traceability matrix

### Action Item Tracking

Action items from alignment reviews should be tracked in the project's issue tracking system with the following information:

- **Title**: Alignment: [Brief description]
- **Description**: Detailed description of the alignment issue
- **Type**: Alignment Issue
- **Priority**: [High / Medium / Low]
- **Affected Artifacts**: List of affected files
- **Assigned To**: Name of the person responsible for resolving the issue
- **Due Date**: Date by which the issue should be resolved
- **Review Source**: Link to the review minutes where the issue was identified

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Technical Lead

- Schedule and facilitate alignment reviews
- Ensure that alignment issues are being addressed
- Update alignment guidelines and checklist as needed
- Report on alignment metrics and trends

### Developers

- Participate in alignment reviews
- Address assigned alignment issues
- Follow alignment guidelines and checklist
- Report new alignment issues as they are discovered

### Product Owner

- Participate in monthly comprehensive reviews
- Provide input on the impact of alignment issues on product quality
- Help prioritize alignment issues

## Metrics and Reporting

The following metrics should be tracked and reported on during alignment reviews:

- **Alignment Coverage**: Percentage of artifacts with verified alignment
- **Alignment Issues**: Number of identified alignment issues by severity
- **Resolution Time**: Average time to resolve alignment issues
- **Regression Rate**: Frequency of reintroduced alignment issues

These metrics should be presented in a dashboard that shows trends over time and highlights areas needing attention.

## Continuous Improvement

The alignment review process should be continuously improved based on feedback from participants and analysis of alignment metrics. Process improvement suggestions should be documented during reviews and implemented as appropriate.

## Conclusion

Regular alignment reviews are essential for maintaining the quality and consistency of the DevSynth project. By following this process, the team can ensure that requirements, specifications, tests, and code remain synchronized throughout the development lifecycle.
