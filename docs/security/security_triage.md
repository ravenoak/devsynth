# Security Scan Triage Workflow

This document defines the standard process for running security scans (Bandit and Safety), interpreting results, and handling suppressions with documented rationale. It aligns with .junie/guidelines.md (Security tools) and the Stabilization Plan (docs/plan.md).

## Tools
- Bandit: static analysis for Python security issues.
  - Recommended command: `poetry run bandit -r src/devsynth -x tests -f json -o security_reports/bandit_report.json`
- Safety: dependency vulnerability scanner.
  - Recommended command: `poetry run safety check --full-report --output json --output-file security_reports/safety_report.json`

CI already runs these tools (see Task 56). This guide is for local triage and documenting decisions.

## Triage Steps
1. Run scans locally (optional) to reproduce CI findings.
2. Classify findings:
   - False positive
   - True positive (needs a fix)
   - Acceptable risk (temporary suppression with timeline)
3. Decide action:
   - Fix immediately if low effort and clear.
   - Suppress only when justified. Every suppression MUST include:
     - Rationale (why acceptable, constraints, plan to remove)
     - Link to an issue/ticket
     - Scope-limited ignore (specific file/check), never global where possible
4. Record outcome:
   - Add an entry to this doc’s “Suppressions Log” (below) with details.
   - Reference the policy files if adding ignores.

## Policy Files
- Bandit policy: `.bandit.yaml`
  - Keep `skips` empty by default. Prefer per-file `# nosec` with a comment explaining the reason and issue link.
- Safety policy: `.safety-policy.toml`
  - Keep `ignore = []` empty by default. If ignoring a vulnerability, include an explicit entry with justification, expiry date, and issue link.

These policy files are present as baselines with zero suppressions to encourage disciplined triage.

## Suppressions Log
- None as of 2025-08-26. All findings should be addressed directly unless documented here with full rationale.

## References
- .junie/guidelines.md (Security tooling commands)
- docs/plan.md (Stabilization priorities)
- docs/policies/security.md (broader security posture)
- .github/workflows (CI jobs that run bandit/safety)
