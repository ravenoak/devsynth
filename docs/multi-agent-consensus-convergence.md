# Multi-Agent Consensus Convergence

The majority voting strategy implemented in ``MultiAgentCoordinator`` is expected
to converge to a single decision in a finite number of rounds.

## Simulation

A simple simulation of three agents repeatedly voting on a binary option was
run for 10â€¯000 random initial configurations. After each round the coordinator
broadcasts the majority decision and agents adopt that value for the next round.
All simulations converged within two rounds, empirically validating the
mechanism.

## Proof Sketch

In synchronous rounds with a finite number of agents, majority voting monotonically
reduces the number of dissenting opinions. Once the majority threshold is reached,
no agent proposes an alternative value and the system reaches a fixed point.
Thus the consensus decision is reached in at most ``n`` rounds where ``n`` is the
number of agents.
