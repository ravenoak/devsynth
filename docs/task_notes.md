Iteration: 2025-09-06 14:45 local
Scope: Acceptance Gate progress (11.2 runtime validation: run full test suite with coverage; confirm gate set at 90; record coverage evidence). No task check-offs this iteration; progress recorded and blockers identified.

Context summary
- Open tasks: 11.2 (overall coverage ≥90% + gate). 11.1 and 11.3 are marked complete.
- pytest.ini currently enforces --cov-fail-under=90 and asyncio_mode=strict; custom markers registered.
- Coverage regression guard present: scripts/compare_coverage.py.

Actions this iteration (runtime evidence)
- Ran: poetry run pytest -q --cov=src/devsynth --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html
- Outcome: 3653 skipped, 59 deselected, 109 warnings; coverage HTML generated under htmlcov/.
- Computed overall coverage from htmlcov/status.json: Statements=38798, Missing=30890, Covered=7908, Percent=20.38%.
- This confirms gate at 90 is configured but overall coverage is far below threshold; cannot complete 11.2 yet.

Assessment vs tasks
- 11.2: NOT MET. Coverage gate present (pytest.ini addopts includes --cov-fail-under=90), but htmlcov shows 20.38% < 90%.

Runtime validation snippets
- Command: poetry run pytest -q --cov=src/devsynth --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html
- Coverage summary (derived): 20.38% overall; htmlcov/status.json parsed for totals.
- Evidence file paths: htmlcov/status.json (present), .coverage (present).

Planned follow-ups
- Prioritize Phase 1/2 coverage uplift per docs/plan.md: expand tests for run_tests_cmd.py, testing/run_tests.py, provider_env.py, and adapter fakes.
- Aim to push overall to ≥55–65% first, then iterate toward ≥90%.

Notes
- Keeping this file concise (<600 lines). Evidence captured via actual test run and coverage JSON parsing.
