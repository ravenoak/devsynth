# Task Notes — Iteration 2025-09-01

Update 4:
- Ran baseline collection: poetry run pytest --collect-only -q → collected successfully (see .output.txt for truncated long output; summary printed).
- Attempted fast unit suite: poetry run devsynth run-tests --target unit-tests --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1 → non-zero exit (failures present). Did not mark 8.2 as done.
- Added LM Studio preflight script: scripts/lmstudio_preflight.py to validate endpoint/env before enabling LM Studio path; supports Tasks 3.5 and 9.2 runbooks.

Context
- Python 3.12.11; pytest 8.4.1; Poetry 2.1.4; devsynth CLI available.
- Default resource flags: DEVSYNTH_OFFLINE=true; DEVSYNTH_PROVIDER=stub; DEVSYNTH_RESOURCE_LMSTUDIO_AVAILABLE=false.

Actions
1) Section 8 progress (matrix)
- 8.1 Baseline discovery: completed (collection + inventory attempt; inventory timed out in this environment earlier — will re-attempt after narrowing scope).
- 8.2 Fast suites: initiated unit-tests fast lane; failures exist requiring follow-up in future iteration; left checkbox unchecked.

2) LM Studio end-to-end readiness
- Added scripts/lmstudio_preflight.py. Verifies env flag and reachability of LM_STUDIO_ENDPOINT with timeout honoring DEVSYNTH_LMSTUDIO_TIMEOUT_SECONDS. Prints guidance if misconfigured.

LM Studio Status
- Offline path: still default (resource flag false); tests should skip.
- Enabled path: preflight in place to reduce flakes; not executed yet.

Evidence
- Command outputs saved under repo working session:
  - pytest collection output (truncated) written to .output.txt by the tool wrapper.
  - devsynth run-tests unit fast attempt exited with code 1; output captured to .output.txt by the tool wrapper.
- New file: scripts/lmstudio_preflight.py (added to VCS in this iteration).

Checklist Updates
- docs/tasks.md: left 8 root unchecked; 8.1 remains [x]; 8.2/8.3 remain [ ]. No other checkbox changes.

Next Focus
- Triage unit fast failures to get 8.2 green; then proceed to integration/behavior fast lanes and segmented medium/slow per docs/plan.md §5.
