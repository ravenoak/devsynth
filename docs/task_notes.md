DevSynth Iteration Notes (Under 200 lines; compact status log)
Date: 2025-09-08T09:10 Local
Maintainer: Junie (autonomous programmer)

Env snapshot (runtime observations):
- Python: 3.12.11 (from pytest banner)
- Platform: darwin
- Coverage gate: pytest.ini enforces fail-under=90 globally (affects subset runs)
- Property tests opt-in: DEVSYNTH_PROPERTY_TESTING=true required

Iteration Goals (from docs/plan.md → docs/tasks.md): Progress Phase 2 with coverage aggregation; maintain evidence after each step.

Actions Performed (chronological, compact):
1) Phase 1 — Property tests remediation
   - Fixed Hypothesis misuse; ensured exactly one speed marker + @pytest.mark.property.
   - Implemented minimal _DummyTeam._improve_clarity in test double to satisfy interface.
   - Validation: DEVSYNTH_PROPERTY_TESTING=true pytest tests/property/test_requirements_consensus_properties.py -q → 3 passed, 0 failed (coverage gate still global).

2) Phase 2 — CLI run-tests coverage uplift
   - Added unit tests for provider defaults, marker ANDing, invalid marker expression; smoke/no-parallel/inventory/features/segment/maxfail/nonexistent target covered across suite.
   - Validation subset: pytest -q tests/unit/application/cli/commands/test_run_tests_cmd_markers.py → 2 passed; narrow-run coverage gate failure expected.
   - Aggregated check: poetry run devsynth run-tests --target unit-tests --speed=fast --no-parallel --report → Success; HTML report path printed.

3) Phase 2 — Additional branches
   - Added report-path advisory coverage (report path missing), more combinations for smoke + no-parallel.
   - Validation subset: pytest -q tests/unit/application/cli/commands/test_run_tests_cmd_report_path.py → 3 passed.

4) Phase 2 — Adapters/Stores fast-path tests
   - Added pure-Python protocol shape tests and resource-gated backend smoke tests (CHROMADB/KUZU/FAISS); default skipped until flags enabled.

5) Phase 2 — UX Bridge non-interactive + logging coverage
   - Added tests for non-interactive ask/confirm defaults and logging branches; validated debug/info/warn/error paths.

6) Phase 0 — Baseline environment and coverage run
   - devsynth doctor; pytest --collect-only -q; marker verification script; reproducibility artifacts saved under diagnostics/.
   - Baseline coverage command: poetry run devsynth run-tests --report --speed=fast --speed=medium --no-parallel → Executed; HTML report pointer printed.

7) Phase 2 — Coverage aggregation (current iteration)
   - Quick discovery check: pytest --collect-only -q → success (very large suite; see .output.txt for truncated listing).
   - Combined coverage + artifacts:
     • coverage combine && coverage html -d htmlcov && coverage json -o coverage.json
     • Result: htmlcov/index.html generated; coverage.json written; coverage combine summary indicated total≈20% (below pytest.ini 90% threshold) — 6.3 remains open.

8) Phase 1 — Preferred path for clarity improvement (2.2.1)
   - Confirmed property tests use public API (apply_dialectical_reasoning) rather than private; kept dummy minimal.
   - Validation: pytest -q tests/property/test_requirements_consensus_properties.py → tests passed; coverage gate failed as expected on narrow subset.

9) Phase 3 — Quick validation and task updates
  - Runtime validation: poetry run pytest --collect-only -q → success (very large suite); smoke already validated earlier.
  - Admin action: Marked docs/tasks.md 14.2 [x] (full fast+medium with HTML report) consistent with prior run; evidence htmlcov/ + test_reports/.

10) Maintainer Quick Actions follow-up
  - Ran property tests (opt-in): DEVSYNTH_PROPERTY_TESTING=true poetry run pytest tests/property/ → coverage gate non-zero exit expected on narrow subset; tests execution verified.
  - Regenerated marker discipline report: poetry run python scripts/verify_test_markers.py --report --report-file test_markers_report.json → 0 issues, 0 violations.

11) Phase 3 — Behavior tests completeness (this iteration)
  - Added behavior scenarios for HTML report and smoke mode; steps implemented to assert report path hint and success.
  - Validation: poetry run pytest -q tests/behavior/test_run_tests.py → scenarios collected and executed; report scenario printed "HTML report available under"; smoke scenario succeeded.

12) Phase 5 — Docs and validation guidance (this iteration)
  - Updated CLI reference with explicit coverage aggregation guidance under run-tests Recommendations.
  - Ran scripts/run_iteration_validation.sh to generate evidence (collection, smoke, fast+medium with report; coverage combine/html/json).
  - Validation: script executed; outputs truncated to .output.txt; artifacts under test_reports/ and htmlcov/ confirmed.

13) Phase 5 — Docs and Issue Tracker alignment (this iteration)
  - Added maintainer setup + resource flags quickstart in docs/plan.md (Phase 5 section).
  - Updated README.md Testing section to summarize provider defaults and offline behavior.
  - Generated diagnostics: issues list, readiness-related grep, behavior related issues cross-ref under diagnostics/.
  - Validation: files present — diagnostics/issues_list.txt, diagnostics/issues_grep_readiness.txt, diagnostics/behavior_related_issues.txt.

14) Phase 4/12 — Coverage-only profile (this iteration)
  - Added a standardized "Coverage-only profile" command block under run-tests in docs/user_guides/cli_command_reference.md.
  - Purpose: standardize local coverage runs to meet pytest.ini fail-under via single-run or segmented combine.
  - Validation guidance: run the documented commands; artifacts htmlcov/index.html, coverage.json, test_reports/*.log.

Evidence Pointers (open locally):
- htmlcov/index.html (coverage HTML)
- coverage.json (combined coverage data)
- test_reports/ (CLI HTML report(s), segmented logs if produced externally)
- test_reports/smoke_fast.log (smoke sanity run log)
- test_reports/full_fast_medium.log (fast+medium run log)
- .output.txt (overflow from large command outputs)
- Source refs for UX bridge: src/devsynth/interface/cli.py lines ~583–616, 635–682

Notes / Blockers / Next Steps:
- Global fail-under=90 will cause non-zero exits for narrow subsets; rely on devsynth run-tests aggregation when asserting readiness.
- Completed docs tasks: 9.2 [x] maintainer setup + resource flags (docs/plan.md section), 9.3 [x] provider defaults + offline behavior (README.md Testing section).
- Completed issue tracker alignment: 11.1–11.3 [x] diagnostics generated under diagnostics/.
- Next iteration focus (per docs/plan.md Phase 3): behavior tests completeness for CLI examples (unit fast no-parallel, report, smoke), and push towards 6.3 by running broader fast+medium segments if needed.
- Combined coverage remains <90% from prior artifacts; 6.3 still open for future iteration (coverage-only profile documented to standardize local runs).
