# Task Notes (DevSynth 0.1.0a1) — Iteration Log

Historical log archived at docs/archived/task_notes_pre2025-09-16.md to keep this file under 200 lines.
Current file condensed on 2025-09-15 to remove redundant 2025-09-13 entries while retaining key decisions and evidence.

## Iteration 2025-09-12A – Environment verification
- Environment: Python 3.12.10; `poetry env info --path` → /root/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/devsynth-MeXVnKii-py3.12.
- Commands:
  - `bash scripts/install_dev.sh` – restored `task --version` 3.44.1.
  - `poetry install --with dev --all-extras` – installed DevSynth entry point.
  - `poetry run devsynth run-tests --smoke --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1` – pass.
  - `poetry run python tests/verify_test_organization.py` – 920 files.
  - `poetry run python scripts/verify_test_markers.py` – 0 issues.
  - `poetry run python scripts/verify_requirements_traceability.py` – all references present.
  - `poetry run python scripts/verify_version_sync.py` – OK.
- Observations: `task` and `devsynth` CLI missing on boot; manual reinstall required. Coverage aggregation and release-state check pending.
- Next: automate CLI/tool provisioning; implement release state check; add BDD coverage for agent_api_stub, chromadb_store, dialectical_reasoning; resolve coverage failure in tests/unit/general/test_test_first_metrics.py.

## Iteration 2025-09-12B – Release state and BDD features
- Environment: Python 3.12.10; virtualenv `/root/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/devsynth-MeXVnKii-py3.12`.
- Commands:
  - `poetry run pre-commit run --files tests/behavior/features/agent_api_stub.feature tests/behavior/steps/test_api_stub_steps.py tests/behavior/features/release_state_check.feature tests/behavior/steps/release_state_steps.py tests/behavior/features/dialectical_reasoning.feature tests/behavior/steps/test_dialectical_reasoning_hooks_steps.py docs/tasks.md docs/task_notes.md docs/plan.md issues/release-state-check.md issues/agent-api-stub-usage.md` – pass.
  - `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1` – pass.
  - `poetry run python scripts/verify_test_markers.py` – 0 issues.
  - `poetry run python scripts/verify_requirements_traceability.py` – success.
- Observations: Added release-state verification and new BDD features for agent API stub and dialectical reasoning; GitHub Actions confirmed dispatch-only; coverage aggregation still needs artifact generation.
- Next: Review proofs for gaps, automate CLI/tool provisioning, restore coverage artifact generation.

## Iteration 2025-09-13 – Consolidated actions
- Environment: Python 3.12.10; `/root/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/devsynth-MeXVnKii-py3.12`; go-task restored to 3.44.1 via `bash scripts/install_dev.sh` when missing.
- Commands (representative across sub-iterations):
  - `task --version`; repeated smoke runs via `poetry run devsynth run-tests --smoke --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1`.
  - Verification scripts (`verify_test_organization`, `verify_test_markers --report`, `verify_requirements_traceability`, `verify_version_sync`).
  - `poetry install --only-root` followed by `poetry install --with dev --extras tests` when CLI missing.
  - `poetry run pre-commit run` on scripts/install_dev.sh, docs/plan.md, docs/tasks.md, docs/task_notes.md, CHANGELOG.md, release docs, strict-typing issues.
  - Attempted `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --no-parallel --report` (timed out or errored on `tests/unit/general/test_test_first_metrics.py`).
- Observations:
  - Closed release-blockers-0-1-0a1 after verifying workflows remain dispatch-only; release-finalization-uat.md opened for UAT tracking.
  - Clarified that maintainers tag `v0.1.0a1` post-UAT and ensured docs/tasks reflect manual tagging.
  - Enhanced scripts/install_dev.sh to detect Python 3.12 via PATH/pyenv, preventing false negatives.
  - Drafted release notes and updated CHANGELOG; strict typing roadmap consolidated and follow-up issues created with pyproject overrides removed for logger/exceptions/CLI.
  - Coverage attempts produced either timeouts or missing artifacts; htmlcov/ omitted due to diff limits; `tests/unit/general/test_test_first_metrics.py` path errors persisted until follow-up work.
- Next: regenerate full coverage artifacts, complete UAT, hand off tagging to maintainers, continue strict typing restorations.

## Iteration 2025-09-14 – Coverage follow-up
- Environment: Python 3.12.10; same virtualenv; `task --version` 3.44.1.
- Commands:
  - `bash scripts/install_dev.sh` (restores go-task).
  - `poetry run devsynth run-tests --smoke --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1` – pass.
  - Verification scripts as above plus `poetry run pytest tests/unit/general/test_test_first_metrics.py` (initially errored due to missing file).
  - `poetry run pre-commit run --files docs/tasks.md docs/task_notes.md docs/plan.md issues/release-blockers-0-1-0a1.md issues/run-tests-missing-test-first-metrics-file.md issues/release-finalization-uat.md` – pass.
  - `poetry run pytest tests/unit/general/test_test_first_metrics.py --cov --cov-report=html --cov-report=json` – pass after path fix.
- Observations: Resolved test path reference but full `devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --report --no-parallel` hung; targeted pytest generated coverage artifacts yet aggregate coverage remained unverified; run-tests coverage issue reopened.
- Next: Restore aggregated coverage, perform UAT, coordinate tagging once coverage meets threshold.

## Iteration 2025-09-15 – Environment verification summary
- Environment: Python 3.12.10; `/root/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/devsynth-MeXVnKii-py3.12`; `task --version` 3.44.1 after reinstall.
- Commands:
  - `bash scripts/install_dev.sh` and `poetry install --with dev --all-extras` to restore CLI/tools.
  - `poetry run devsynth run-tests --smoke --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1` – pass.
  - Verification scripts (`verify_test_organization`, `verify_test_markers --report`, `verify_requirements_traceability`, `verify_version_sync`).
- Observations: Fresh sessions lacked go-task/CLI until reinstall; smoke tests and verification scripts pass but coverage and UAT remain blockers.
- Next: Execute full coverage run with instrumentation fixes, complete User Acceptance Testing, and prepare maintainer tagging.

## Iteration 2025-09-15 – Coverage regression analysis (current)
- Environment: Python 3.12.10; `/root/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/devsynth-MeXVnKii-py3.12`; `task --version` 3.45.3 after rerunning install script.
- Commands (today):
  - `bash scripts/install_dev.sh` – reinstalls go-task and runs Poetry install.
  - `poetry run devsynth run-tests --smoke --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1` – pass.
  - `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --no-parallel --report --maxfail=1` – pass but coverage low.
  - `poetry run python tests/verify_test_organization.py`, `poetry run python scripts/verify_test_markers.py --report --report-file test_markers_report.json`, `poetry run python scripts/verify_requirements_traceability.py`, `poetry run python scripts/verify_version_sync.py` – all pass.
  - Parsed `test_reports/coverage.json` → 13.68 % coverage; observed empty `htmlcov/index.html`.
- Observations: Aggregated coverage regressed to 13.68 % despite successful run; htmlcov output zero bytes; reopened issues/coverage-below-threshold.md; added docs/tasks.md section 21 for coverage remediation; plan/tasks updated to reflect unmet coverage gate.
- Next: Repair coverage instrumentation, raise coverage for highlighted modules (output_formatter, webui, webui_bridge, logging_setup, reasoning_loop, testing/run_tests), implement automated coverage gate, regenerate artifacts before UAT.

## Iteration 2025-09-15B – Smoke profile coverage gap
- Environment: Python 3.12.10; Poetry env `/root/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/devsynth-MeXVnKii-py3.12`; `task --version` 3.45.3.
- Commands:
  - `poetry run devsynth run-tests --smoke --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1` → initial attempt failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'devsynth'` until `poetry install --with dev --all-extras` restored the entry point.
  - Re-ran the smoke command post-install; CLI completed but emitted "Unable to determine total coverage…" twice and `test_reports/coverage.json` contained `{}` with zero-byte HTML coverage.
  - Confirmed existing aggregated coverage artifact still reports 13.68 % via JSON totals.
- Observations: Smoke mode sets `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1`, preventing pytest-cov from writing `.coverage`, so enforcement degrades to a warning; added docs/tasks.md §21.8 and plan updates to capture remediation options.
- Next: Track a fix ensuring smoke runs either load pytest-cov explicitly or bypass coverage enforcement when intentionally skipping instrumentation; coordinate with issues/coverage-below-threshold.md.

## Iteration 2025-09-16 – Coverage instrumentation audit
- Environment: Python 3.12.10; `/root/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/devsynth-MeXVnKii-py3.12`; `~/.local/bin/task --version` 3.45.3 after `bash scripts/install_dev.sh`.
- Commands:
  - `poetry install --with dev --all-extras` (clean reinstall to restore `devsynth` entry point).
  - `poetry run devsynth run-tests --smoke --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1`.
  - `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --no-parallel --report --maxfail=1`.
- Observations: Both commands print "Unable to determine total coverage" and leave `.coverage` missing even though `--cov` arguments are passed; `test_reports/coverage.json` reverts to 13.68 % only after restoring the previous artifact from git. Added docs/tasks.md §22–23 to capture instrumentation fixes and documentation promotions.
- Next: Diagnose missing `.coverage`, add regression tests for `totals.percent_covered`, and promote draft invariant notes once coverage improvements land.

## Iteration 2025-09-16B – Coverage artifact remediation
- Environment: Python 3.12.10; Poetry env `/root/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/devsynth-MeXVnKii-py3.12`.
- Commands:
  - `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 PYTEST_ADDOPTS="-k test_that_does_not_exist --maxfail=1" poetry run devsynth run-tests --target all-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --no-parallel --report` – now exits with remediation instead of leaving `{}` coverage artifacts.【7cb697†L1-L3】
  - `poetry run pytest tests/unit/testing/test_run_tests_cli_invocation.py::test_run_tests_generates_coverage_totals tests/unit/application/cli/test_run_tests_cmd.py::test_cli_reports_coverage_percent` (new regression coverage suite).
- Observations: `_ensure_coverage_artifacts()` now refuses to emit placeholders when `.coverage` is missing and the CLI surfaces actionable guidance. The regression tests confirm `test_reports/coverage.json` includes `totals.percent_covered`, meeting the ≥90 % gate precondition.
- Next: Run the full aggregate profile once remaining coverage hot spots receive tests so the gate can pass without manual intervention.

## Iteration 2025-09-17 – Coverage instrumentation regression resurfaced
- Environment: Python 3.12.10 (`python --version`) with Poetry env `/root/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/devsynth-MeXVnKii-py3.12`; reran `bash scripts/install_dev.sh` and confirmed `task --version` 3.45.3 afterward.【a5710f†L1-L2】【1c714f†L1-L3】
- Commands:
  - `bash scripts/install_dev.sh` (restored go-task and refreshed verification hooks).【c08481†L1-L4】
  - `poetry run devsynth run-tests --smoke --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1` → success but printed "Coverage artifact generation skipped" and left `test_reports/coverage.json` absent.【d5fad8†L1-L4】
  - `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --no-parallel --report --maxfail=1` → exited with code 1 because `.coverage` was missing even though tests completed; coverage HTML/JSON not generated.【20dbec†L1-L5】【45de43†L1-L2】
  - `jq '.totals.percent_covered' test_reports/coverage.json` before the regression cleaned the artifact → 20.78 % (last captured measurement prior to deletion).【cbc560†L1-L3】
- Observations: Smoke and aggregate runs both drop `.coverage`; coverage gate cannot evaluate, blocking tasks 6.3, 13.3, 19.3, and §21.8/§21.11. Need to add regression tests ensuring `.coverage` persists when the CLI injects `-p pytest_cov` under `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1`.

## Iteration 2025-09-17C – Invariant publications and targeted coverage refresh
- Environment: Python 3.12.10; reused `/root/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/devsynth-MeXVnKii-py3.12`.
- Commands:
  - `poetry run coverage run -m pytest --override-ini addopts="" tests/unit/interface/test_output_formatter_core_behaviors.py tests/unit/interface/test_output_formatter_fallbacks.py` followed by `coverage json/html` to capture formatter coverage artifacts (24.42 % line coverage).【674ed7†L1-L24】【3eb35b†L1-L9】
  - `poetry run coverage run -m pytest --override-ini addopts="" tests/unit/methodology/edrr/test_reasoning_loop_invariants.py` and corresponding `coverage json/html` to lock reasoning loop safeguards (54.02 % coverage).【368e8f†L1-L18】【cd0fac†L1-L9】
  - `DEVSYNTH_PROPERTY_TESTING=true poetry run coverage run -m pytest --override-ini addopts="" tests/property/test_webui_properties.py` to produce WebUI state coverage (52.24 %) without requiring Streamlit.【52a70d†L1-L17】【a9203c†L1-L9】
  - `poetry run coverage run -m pytest --override-ini addopts="" tests/unit/application/cli/commands/test_run_tests_cmd_inventory.py` to document run-tests CLI inventory instrumentation (32.77 %).【4a0778†L1-L19】【7e4fe3†L1-L9】
  - `DEVSYNTH_PROPERTY_TESTING=true poetry run pytest --override-ini addopts="" tests/property/test_reasoning_loop_properties.py` → fails because tests still monkeypatch `_apply_dialectical_reasoning`; flagged for follow-up before re-enabling property coverage claims.【df7365†L1-L55】
- Observations: All four invariant notes are now published with artifact links and quantitative coverage baselines; reasoning loop property suite requires repair to align with the new `_import_apply_dialectical_reasoning` helper.
- Next: Run the full aggregate profile once remaining coverage hot spots receive tests so the gate can pass without manual intervention.

## Iteration 2025-09-17D – Adapter lint/bandit remediation
- Environment: Python 3.12.10; Poetry env `/root/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/devsynth-MeXVnKii-py3.12`; `task --version` 3.45.3.
- Commands:
  - `poetry run flake8 src/ tests/ | tee diagnostics/flake8_2025-09-17_run1.txt`.
  - `poetry run bandit -r src/devsynth -x tests | tee diagnostics/bandit_2025-09-17.txt`.
- Observations: Trimmed long lines, removed unused imports, and replaced `except ... pass` in adapters, `__init__`, and Kuzu store; flake8 run still fails due to historic violations in tests, while bandit reports 146 low-confidence subprocess warnings pending broader risk review.
- Next: Schedule follow-up to refactor legacy test fixtures and review remaining subprocess usage across CLI and MVU utilities.
