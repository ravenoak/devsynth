2025-09-08:
- Environment lacked `task`; ran scripts/install_dev.sh to install v3.44.1.
- Executed `poetry install --with dev --extras "tests retrieval chromadb api"` to fix missing `devsynth` module.
- Restored missing sentinel test `tests/test_speed_dummy.py` to satisfy organization checks.
- Fast tests now pass; verify scripts succeed.
- Outstanding: validate medium/slow tests and resolve pytest-xdist errors.
2025-09-09:
- `task` command missing again; reinstalled via scripts/install_dev.sh (v3.44.1).
- Fast tests pass (162 passed, 27 skipped); `scripts/verify_test_markers.py` reports zero test files.
- Release readiness still blocked by unresolved pytest-xdist errors and unverified medium/slow tests.
2025-09-10:
- Reinstalled go-task via scripts/install_dev.sh; confirmed `task --version` outputs v3.44.1.
- Dependency installation was interrupted, so additional verification steps remain.

2025-09-11:
- Re-executed `poetry install --with dev --extras "tests retrieval chromadb api"` and confirmed CLI with `poetry run devsynth --help`.
