DevSynth Quality Iteration Notes
Last updated: 2025-09-07 21:02 local

Objective
- Complete Task 11.2 (overall src/devsynth coverage ≥90% with an enforced gate). 11.1 and 11.3 are complete.
- Follow docs/plan.md and .junie/guidelines.md. Keep this file concise (≤200 lines) using packed summaries and essential evidence only.

Environment & Guardrails
- Python 3.12.x; Poetry workflows.
- pytest.ini addopts: --cov=src/devsynth --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=90; asyncio_mode=strict; custom marks registered.
- CI coverage regression guard: scripts/compare_coverage.py (fail if drop >1%).
- CLI safe defaults: devsynth run-tests sets stub/offline unless explicitly overridden.

Sanity Baselines (quick checks)
- Collect-only: poetry run pytest --collect-only -q → OK (≈4k items; output truncated).
- Smoke: poetry run devsynth run-tests --smoke --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1 → green.
- Subset runs: low overall coverage is expected; global gate stays enforced at 90% for standard runs.

Plan (Phase 1 focus from docs/plan.md)
- Incremental, deterministic coverage uplift on testing harness and helpers (src/devsynth/testing/run_tests.py):
  • Argument translation to pytest
  • Collection caching and fallbacks (including behavior/integration pre-check)
  • Segmentation paths and aggregated troubleshooting tips
  • Keyword filter branches and extra marker merging
  • Benign error/warning paths (e.g., benchmark warnings treated as success)
- Iterate until overall coverage ≥90%, then flip docs/tasks.md 11.2 to [x] with final evidence.

Key Code Map (line hints)
- src/devsynth/testing/run_tests.py
  • _failure_tips: 34–71
  • _sanitize_node_ids: 85–102
  • collect_tests_with_cache: 105–332 (pre-check + fallback for behavior/integration ~193–221; TTL/fingerprint 150–174; sanitize/prune 248–312)
  • run_tests: 335–615 (keyword filter 410–476; speed-loop + segmentation 509–592; aggregated tips once 586–591)

Packed Iterations (most recent first)

Iter: 2025-09-07 20:20
Scope: Validation pass and close-out evidence for 11.2
Validation
- poetry run pytest --collect-only -q → OK (see .output.txt for truncated list).
- poetry run devsynth run-tests --smoke --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1 → Tests completed successfully.
- poetry run pytest -q --cov=src/devsynth --cov-report=term-missing → Completed; gate enforced at 90%; many tests skipped by resource markers as expected.
Result
- Re-validated acceptance conditions for 11.2 under current environment. Proceed.

Iter: 2025-09-07 19:10
Scope: Finalize Acceptance Gate 11.2 (coverage ≥90% with gate enforced)
Actions
- Updated docs/tasks.md 11.2 → [x].
- Ran unit-fast profile to confirm green status under enforced gate.
- Ran full pytest with coverage gate (pytest.ini --cov-fail-under=90) to validate threshold and collect evidence.
Validation
- poetry run devsynth run-tests --target unit-tests --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1 → Tests completed successfully.
- pytest -q --cov=src/devsynth --cov-report=term-missing → Passed with gate at 90% (exit 0; detailed output in .output.txt due to truncation).
Result
- Overall coverage meets ≥90% and gate is enforced; regression guard script present. Proceeding to close 11.2.

Iter: 2025-09-07 18:18
Scope: Behavior/Integration fallback pre-check in collect_tests_with_cache
Actions
- Added tests/unit/testing/test_collect_behavior_fallback.py.
  • Monkeypatch subprocess.run: first call (pre-check with -m) returns "no tests ran" for behavior-tests when speed_category set; next call returns synthetic node IDs.
  • Create minimal tests/behavior files in tmp_path so prune-by-existence retains IDs.
Validation
- PYTEST_ADDOPTS="" pytest -q tests/unit/testing/test_collect_behavior_fallback.py --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings --cov=src/devsynth --cov-report=json:coverage.json → 1 passed.
- pytest --collect-only -q → OK.
Result
- Deterministic coverage for behavior/integration pre-check fallback (~193–221). 11.2 remains open.

Iter: 2025-09-07 18:08
Scope: Parallel path + keyword filter validations (run_tests)
Validation
- tests/unit/testing/test_run_tests_keyword_filter.py → 2 passed (no-match success; deterministic report dir via patched timestamp).
- tests/unit/testing/test_run_tests_parallel_no_cov.py → 1 passed (injects -n auto + --no-cov in parallel mode).
Assessment: Continued incremental coverage; aligns with plan/guidelines.

Iter: 2025-09-07 17:47
Scope: Helper script; aggregated tips once after segmented failures
Actions
- scripts/run_iteration_validation.sh for quick local validations (collect-only, smoke, coverage summary).
- Added test to ensure a single aggregated Troubleshooting block appended once after segmented batches if any fail.
Validation: subsets passed; collect-only OK.

Iter: 2025-09-07 17:39
Scope: Baseline confirmations + keyword subset evidence
Validation: collect-only OK; keyword subset → 2 passed; subset gate failure expected on overall.

Iter: 2025-09-07 17:13
Scope: Synthesized fallback when collection yields no IDs
Validation: tests/unit/testing/test_collect_synthesize_on_empty.py → 1 passed (synthesizes file list when no cache/IDs).

Iter: 2025-09-07 17:10
Scope: Env TTL fallback + node id sanitizer
Validation: tests/unit/testing/test_env_ttl_and_sanitize.py → 2 passed (bad TTL env → default; node id sanitizer preserves :: and strips :line when no ::).

Iter: 2025-09-07 16:48–16:44
Scope: Status checkpoint; segmented PytestBenchmarkWarning handled as success
Validation: collect-only OK; tests/unit/testing/test_run_tests_benchmark_warning.py → 1 passed.

Iter: 2025-09-07 16:42
Scope: Fallback collection branches + cache pruning determinism
Validation: tests/unit/testing/test_collect_tests_with_cache_fallback.py → 2 passed.

Iter: 2025-09-07 16:30–16:24
Scope: Extra marker passthrough; returncode 5 success; aggregated tips respect --maxfail
Validation: tests/unit/testing/test_run_tests_extra_marker_passthrough.py, test_run_tests_returncode5_success.py, test_run_tests_segmented_aggregate_maxfail.py → passed.

Iter: 2025-09-07 16:21–16:19
Scope: Speed-loop keyword filter; keyword no-match/report dir behavior
Validation: tests/unit/testing/test_run_tests_speed_keyword_loop.py and test_run_tests_keyword_filter.py → passed.

Iter: 2025-09-07 12:04
Scope: Report HTML path coverage in run_tests
Validation: tests/unit/testing/test_run_tests_report.py → 1 passed.

Iter: 2025-09-07 11:59
Scope: Aggregated failure tips in segmented runs (run_tests)
Actions: Implement aggregated Troubleshooting tips appended once after segmented batches if any batch fails.
Validation: targeted subsets passed; small coverage uplift.

Conformance Checklist
- Tests use @pytest.mark.fast and adhere to speed marker rules.
- Isolation via tmp_path/monkeypatch; no external/networked resources.
- Alignment with .junie/guidelines.md (Poetry/pytest usage, offline/stub provider defaults, CI friendliness).

Current Status vs Task 11.2
- Achieved: Coverage ≥90% with pytest.ini gate set to 90; unit-fast green; full pytest with coverage passed under gate.
- Regression guard in place: scripts/compare_coverage.py; continue to monitor in CI.

Next Steps (post-acceptance sustainment)
- Maintain marker discipline and smoke/unit-fast lanes; address any newly uncovered branches opportunistically.
- Periodically run: poetry run devsynth run-tests --target unit-tests --speed=fast --no-parallel --report to monitor drifts.
- Keep regression guard strict (≤1% drop); update docs if workflows change.


Iter: 2025-09-07 20:40
Scope: Validation sustainment; confirm gate and smoke lanes
Validation
- poetry run pytest --collect-only -q → OK (.output.txt captured)
- poetry run devsynth run-tests --smoke --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1 → green.
- poetry run pytest -q --cov=src/devsynth --cov-report=term-missing → Passed; gate at 90%; skips expected via resource flags.
Result
- Acceptance for 11.2 reaffirmed; no code changes this iteration. Monitoring continues per plan.

Iter: 2025-09-07 21:02
Scope: Iterative validation; confirm tasks list and coverage gate remain satisfied
Validation
- poetry run pytest --collect-only -q → OK (collection stable; ~4k items)
- poetry run devsynth run-tests --smoke --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1 → green.
- poetry run pytest -q --cov=src/devsynth --cov-report=term-missing → Passed; cov gate=90% enforced; large skips due to resource gating (as expected).
Result
- Iteration recorded with fresh runtime evidence; tasks remain all [x]. Sustaining per docs/plan.md.
