2025-09-15:
- Reopened task 1.5 to confirm medium and slow test suites run without pytest-xdist errors.
- Reopened task 6.4 after `scripts/verify_test_markers.py` reported zero test files.
- Updated release plan and tasks to track these outstanding issues.

# Task Notes — Iteration 2025-09-01

Update 4:
- Ran baseline collection: poetry run pytest --collect-only -q → collected successfully (see .output.txt for truncated long output; summary printed).
- Attempted fast unit suite: poetry run devsynth run-tests --target unit-tests --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1 → non-zero exit (failures present). Did not mark 8.2 as done.
- Added LM Studio preflight script: scripts/lmstudio_preflight.py to validate endpoint/env before enabling LM Studio path; supports Tasks 3.5 and 9.2 runbooks.

Context
- Python 3.12.11; pytest 8.4.1; Poetry 2.1.4; devsynth CLI available.
- Default resource flags: DEVSYNTH_OFFLINE=true; DEVSYNTH_PROVIDER=stub; DEVSYNTH_RESOURCE_LMSTUDIO_AVAILABLE=false.

Actions
1) Section 8 progress (matrix)
- 8.1 Baseline discovery: completed (collection + inventory attempt; inventory timed out in this environment earlier — will re-attempt after narrowing scope).
- 8.2 Fast suites: initiated unit-tests fast lane; failures exist requiring follow-up in future iteration; left checkbox unchecked.

2) LM Studio end-to-end readiness
- Added scripts/lmstudio_preflight.py. Verifies env flag and reachability of LM_STUDIO_ENDPOINT with timeout honoring DEVSYNTH_LMSTUDIO_TIMEOUT_SECONDS. Prints guidance if misconfigured.

LM Studio Status
- Offline path: still default (resource flag false); tests should skip.
- Enabled path: preflight in place to reduce flakes; not executed yet.

Evidence
- Command outputs saved under repo working session:
  - pytest collection output (truncated) written to .output.txt by the tool wrapper.
  - devsynth run-tests unit fast attempt exited with code 1; output captured to .output.txt by the tool wrapper.
- New file: scripts/lmstudio_preflight.py (added to VCS in this iteration).

Checklist Updates
- docs/tasks.md: left 8 root unchecked; 8.1 remains [x]; 8.2/8.3 remain [ ]. No other checkbox changes.

Next Focus
- Triage unit fast failures to get 8.2 green; then proceed to integration/behavior fast lanes and segmented medium/slow per docs/plan.md §5.

Notes (2025-08-31):
- Verification for WebUI optionality and doctor import path.
  - Added scripts/verify_doctor_import.py to exercise the historical failing import chain without installing Streamlit.
  - Ran the script; evidence written to diagnostics/doctor_after.txt. Result: all modules imported successfully; no ModuleNotFoundError for streamlit.
  - Rationale: Confirms lazy import behavior in src/devsynth/interface/webui.py and guarded usage in webui_cmd.py/webui_bridge.py per docs/plan.md and .junie/guidelines.md.
- Doctor runtime check:
  - Executed doctor command path via Python to ensure it runs in-place without optional WebUI deps. Output captured in diagnostics/doctor_after.txt by the verification script; a separate run confirmed import path OK.
  - Acceptance: complements Task 1.3/2.5 validations already marked done in docs/tasks.md.
- Guardrails progress (Task 6.1):
  - Ran Black check: poetry run black --check . → reports 27 files would be reformatted; isort not yet run. Do not mark 6.1 complete.
  - Next iteration plan: format a minimal, high-signal subset (scripts/ and most-touched modules) or introduce a staged formatter task, aligning with minimal-change guidance.
- Next iteration priorities:
  - Progress Task 6.1 by addressing formatter-only diffs in a small, low-risk batch.
  - Begin Section 8 fast test runs using smoke where applicable and capture outputs under diagnostics/.
  - Prepare LM Studio stability runner invocation (Taskfile target exists) and record 3× runs evidence for Task 3.5.
- Alignment: Kept notes concise, actionable, and evidence-linked per .junie/guidelines.md; no speculative checkbox edits.

## 2025-08-31 Iteration: Formatter guardrails (Task 6.1)

Context
- Aligns with docs/plan.md guardrails and .junie/guidelines.md. Prior notes indicated Black would reformat ~27 files.

Actions taken
- Ran formatter checks and then auto-applied fixes repository-wide:
  - Black check (pre): diagnostics/black_check_2025-08-31T1230.txt
  - isort check (pre): diagnostics/isort_check_2025-08-31T1231.txt
  - Applied isort: diagnostics/isort_apply_2025-08-31T1232.txt
  - Applied Black: diagnostics/black_apply_2025-08-31T1233.txt
  - Black check (post): diagnostics/black_check_after_2025-08-31T1234.txt
  - isort check (post): diagnostics/isort_check_after_2025-08-31T1234.txt
- Sanity: pytest --collect-only -q → diagnostics/pytest_collect_after_format_2025-08-31T1235.txt

Outcome
- Black and isort now pass cleanly (isort reports only "Skipped 2 files" as expected by config).
- No functional changes; only formatting/import order adjustments.
- Updated docs/tasks.md: marked 6.1 as complete.

Next steps
- Proceed with guardrails 6.2–6.5 (flake8, mypy, bandit, safety) in staged, high-signal passes.
- Begin Section 8 fast suites with smoke/no-parallel and capture evidence under diagnostics/.

Notes (2025-08-28):
- Completed 2.1–2.4: audited and implemented lazy/guarded Streamlit imports.
- webui.py: removed module-scope Streamlit import; added lazy loader and _LazyStreamlit proxy that raises DevSynthError with install guidance when missing.
- webui_bridge.py: removed module-scope Streamlit import; _require_streamlit now lazily imports via importlib and raises DevSynthError with clear guidance.
- webui_cmd.py: command remains visible; uses lazy import of webui.run and now catches ModuleNotFoundError and DevSynthError to show installation guidance. This satisfies the “graceful on invocation” path for 2.3.
- Next iteration: verify 2.5 and 1.3 by running devsynth doctor in a minimal env; then proceed to Task 3 (LM Studio stability) and Task 7 doc updates.
- Potential follow-up: audit other Streamlit usages (enhanced_error_handler.py, mvuu_dashboard.py, webui_state.py) if they surface in doctor/CLI paths.
