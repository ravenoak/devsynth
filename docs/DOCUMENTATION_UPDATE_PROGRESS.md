# Documentation Update Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of the documentation cleanup and organization effort for the DevSynth project.

## Current Date

August 2, 2025

## Goals

- Review all existing documentation
- Identify redundant, outdated, or trivial (ROT) content
- Consolidate similar documents
- Ensure documentation hierarchy is logical and intuitive
- Create missing documentation where needed
- Ensure all documentation is relevant, coherent, and harmonious
- Delete unnecessary files
- Apply dialectical and Socratic reasoning to documentation improvements

## Approach

This documentation cleanup and improvement plan uses a multi-disciplined approach driven by dialectical and Socratic reasoning:

### Dialectical Reasoning Approach

The dialectical reasoning process follows a thesis-antithesis-synthesis pattern:
1. **Thesis**: Identify the current state of documentation and its strengths
2. **Antithesis**: Critically examine limitations, gaps, and inconsistencies
3. **Synthesis**: Develop improved documentation that preserves strengths while addressing limitations

### Socratic Questioning Approach

We apply Socratic questioning to guide the documentation improvement process:
1. **Clarification**: What is the purpose of this document? Who is the audience?
2. **Assumption Examination**: What assumptions does this documentation make about the reader?
3. **Evidence Inquiry**: What evidence supports the documentation's claims and instructions?
4. **Alternative Perspectives**: How might different users interpret this documentation?
5. **Implication Analysis**: What are the consequences of following/not following this documentation?
6. **Meta-Reflection**: How can we improve our documentation process itself?

## Current Findings

### Documentation Structure

The project has a well-defined documentation structure organized into directories:

- getting_started/ - For new users
- user_guides/ - For end users
- developer_guides/ - For contributors
- architecture/ - System design
- technical_reference/ - API and technical details
- analysis/ - Project analysis
- implementation/ - Implementation status
- specifications/ - Project specifications
- roadmap/ - Future plans
- policies/ - Project policies

## Notes

The project is an agentic software engineering platform that uses LLMs, memory systems, and dialectical reasoning to automate software development. It has a hexagonal architecture with clear separation of concerns and emphasizes traceability, extensibility, and resilience.

The documentation cleanup and improvement plan is being tracked in this document, which replaces the temporary TASK_PROGRESS.md file previously used during local development.
