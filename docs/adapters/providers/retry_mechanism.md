# Retry Mechanism with Exponential Backoff

## Overview

The DevSynth project includes a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff for handling transient errors when interacting with external services like OpenAI API. This document describes the implementation, usage, and testing of this mechanism.

## Implementation

The retry mechanism is implemented as a decorator function `retry_with_exponential_backoff` in the `fallback.py` module. It provides the following features:

- Configurable maximum number of retry attempts
- Exponential backoff with initial and maximum delay settings
- Optional jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
- Detailed logging of retry attempts

## Usage

The decorator can be applied to any function that might experience transient failures:

```python
from devsynth.adapters.providers.fallback import retry_with_exponential_backoff

@retry_with_exponential_backoff(max_retries=3, initial_delay=1.0, max_delay=10.0, jitter=True)
def call_external_api():
    # Function that might fail transiently
    response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()
```

## Parameters

- `max_retries` (int): Maximum number of retry attempts (default: 3)
- `initial_delay` (float): Initial delay between retries in seconds (default: 1.0)
- `max_delay` (float): Maximum delay between retries in seconds (default: 60.0)
- `backoff_factor` (float): Factor by which the delay increases (default: 2.0)
- `jitter` (bool): Whether to add random jitter to the delay (default: True)

## Testing

The retry mechanism is thoroughly tested using both unit tests and behavior-driven development (BDD) tests:

- Unit tests verify the core functionality, including successful retries, failures after maximum retries, and proper implementation of exponential backoff with jitter.
- BDD tests ensure that the retry mechanism behaves as expected from a user's perspective, with scenarios covering various use cases.

## Integration with Providers

The retry mechanism is integrated with various provider implementations, such as the OpenAI provider, to handle rate limiting and transient API errors gracefully.

```python
class OpenAIProvider(BaseProvider):
    @retry_with_exponential_backoff(max_retries=3, initial_delay=1.0, max_delay=10.0)
    def generate_text(self, prompt, **kwargs):
        # Implementation that calls OpenAI API
        pass
```

## Error Handling

The retry mechanism logs each retry attempt with increasing severity levels. After the maximum number of retries is reached, the original exception is re-raised to the caller for appropriate handling.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for conditional retries based on exception types
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for persistent failures
- Add metrics collection for retry attempts and success rates
## Implementation Status
This feature is **partially implemented**. Conditional retry logic is now
available, but circuit breaker integration and detailed metrics collection are
still planned.
