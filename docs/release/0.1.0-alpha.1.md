# DevSynth 0.1.0a1

This document tracks final checklist updates and artifacts for the 0.1.0a1 pre‑release tag.

## Summary
- Focus on CLI stability, provider offline‑by‑default, speed‑marker discipline, and release readiness automation per docs/plan.md.

## Blockers and Status
- CI Dry Run (release_prep_dry_run): Pending confirmation on main
- Security audits: Configured; artifacts expected from CI (Bandit, Safety)
- Release preparation (`task release:prep`): Pending local confirmation
- Final full fast+medium coverage run: Pending
- User Acceptance Testing: Pending

## Artifacts
- Wheel/SDist: TBA
- Smoke test report: test_reports/ (HTML report when --report is enabled; see CI artifacts)
- Marker verification report: test_markers_report.json (published by CI)
- Security reports: bandit_report.txt; safety_report.txt (published by CI)
- Dialectical audit log: dialectical_audit.log

## Notable Changes
- Hardened run-tests smoke mode (PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1) and default timeouts
- Provider defaults enforced via CLI (offline/stub by default) and verified by tests
- Speed marker verification and fixer scripts; pre-commit gate added
- CI workflows publish key artifacts (markers, smoke, security)

## How to Verify
1. Run local release prep: `task release:prep`
2. Confirm CI dry run workflow passes: `.github/workflows/release_prep_dry_run.yml`
3. Inspect attached reports and artifacts under test_reports/ and root-level JSON/TXT artifacts
