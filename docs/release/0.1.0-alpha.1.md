# DevSynth 0.1.0a1

This document tracks final checklist updates and artifacts for the 0.1.0a1 pre‑release tag.

## Summary
- **ALPHA RELEASE**: Functional validation remains the focus, but release gates now enforce the production-quality expectations documented in docs/plan.md.
- CLI stability, provider offline‑by‑default, speed‑marker discipline, and release readiness automation per docs/plan.md
- **CI TRIGGERS**: GitHub Actions workflows stay manual-only via `workflow_dispatch` until v0.1.0a1 is tagged, preventing accidental push/pull_request/schedule executions while the gates remain red.【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L1-L11】
- **Quality Threshold**: ≥90 % aggregated coverage from the fast+medium profile (`poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --report --no-parallel`) with artifacts archived under `artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/`. The 2025-10-12 aggregate stored evidence in `20251012T164512Z-fast-medium/`, logged the knowledge-graph publication banner (`QualityGate=QG-20251012-FASTMED`, `TestRun=TR-20251012-FASTMED`, `ReleaseEvidence=RE-20251012-FASTMED`), and recorded 92.40 % line coverage (2,601/2,815 statements). The HTML snapshot ships as a Base64-encoded archive (`htmlcov-20251012T164512Z-fast-medium.zip.base64`) with decode instructions and the SHA-256 of the decoded zip captured alongside the manifest to satisfy the repository's text-only artifact policy.【F:artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/20251012T164512Z-fast-medium/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20251012T164512Z.txt†L1-L9】【F:artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/20251012T164512Z-fast-medium/coverage.json†L1-L152】【F:test_reports/coverage_manifest_20251012T164512Z.json†L1-L56】【F:artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/20251012T164512Z-fast-medium/htmlcov-20251012T164512Z-fast-medium.manifest.txt†L1-L5】【F:artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/20251012T164512Z-fast-medium/htmlcov-20251012T164512Z-fast-medium.zip.sha256†L1-L2】
- **Hot-spot delta tracking (2025-10-05 fast sweep)**: Targeted reruns for `methodology/edrr/reasoning_loop.py` capture a 68.89 % fast-only snapshot while refactors are staged, preserving evidence under `20251015T000000Z-fast-medium/` for cross-checking against the ≥90 % objective before the final aggregate rerun.【F:artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/20251015T000000Z-fast-medium/reasoning_loop_fast.json†L1-L25】
- **CLI Behavior**: `devsynth run-tests` now forwards the repository default `--cov-fail-under=90` and reminds operators in smoke mode that the 90 % gate must be rechecked after triage, keeping coverage enforcement consistent across automation and manual runs.【F:pyproject.toml†L309-L317】【F:src/devsynth/application/cli/commands/run_tests_cmd.py†L415-L436】
- **Coverage instrumentation contract**: The harness probes for `pytest_cov` before attaching `--cov` flags and emits a `[coverage] pytest plugin 'pytest_cov' not found…` banner with reinstall guidance when the plugin is absent. The CLI exits immediately for missing plugins or autoloaded environments without `-p pytest_cov`, printing remediation so operators can recover before rerunning release rehearsals.【F:src/devsynth/testing/run_tests.py†L343-L376】【F:src/devsynth/application/cli/commands/run_tests_cmd.py†L321-L353】
- **Coverage remediation timeline (2025-10-12 update)**: All three milestones now have archived evidence and knowledge-graph identifiers.
  1. **2025-10-05 – CLI orchestration uplift** ✅ HTML/JSON bundles and diagnostics deposited under the pending hot-spot tree and referenced by the October aggregate summary.【F:diagnostics/testing/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20251012T164512Z_summary.txt†L1-L13】
  2. **2025-10-07 – WebUI and provider bridge coverage** ✅ Streamlit-free dashboards and provider resilience suites rerun with `pytest-cov`, feeding the coverage manifest that now reports ≥87 % for the targeted modules.【F:test_reports/coverage_manifest_20251012T164512Z.json†L1-L44】
  3. **2025-10-10 – Full fast+medium aggregate** ✅ Coverage gate cleared with 92.40 % line coverage; artifacts and SHA-256 digests live under `20251012T164512Z-fast-medium/` and the CLI banner published the QualityGate/TestRun/ReleaseEvidence IDs.【F:artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/20251012T164512Z-fast-medium/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20251012T164512Z.txt†L1-L9】【F:artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/20251012T164512Z-fast-medium/coverage.json†L1-L152】
- **Release knowledge graph automation**: Successful `devsynth run-tests --report` executions now emit timestamped coverage manifests under `test_reports/coverage_manifest_<UTC>.json`, compute SHA-256 digests, and publish `ReleaseEvidence`, `TestRun`, and `QualityGate` nodes to the release knowledge graph. The CLI prints the node identifiers so operators can cross-reference evidence in subsequent rehearsals.
- **Targeted regression harness (2025-10-03)**: New fast suites assert the
  `--report` remediation banner, segmented failure guidance, marker fallback
  messaging, and progress timeline alias rebinding so the remaining low-coverage
  regions in `run_tests_cmd`, `testing/run_tests`, and the long-running progress
  simulator now execute deterministically during CI rehearsals.【F:tests/unit/application/cli/commands/test_run_tests_cmd_report_guidance.py†L18-L184】【F:tests/unit/testing/test_run_tests_marker_fallback.py†L13-L53】【F:tests/unit/application/cli/commands/test_long_running_progress_timeline_bridge.py†L1-L140】
- **Configuration Safety**: Config loader now uses a standard dataclass with bounded JSON validation depth, preventing recursive schema expansion when parsing nested resources. Runtime helpers normalize JSON values and guard TOML/YAML optional dependencies.【F:src/devsynth/core/config_loader.py†L20-L107】【F:src/devsynth/core/config_loader.py†L114-L178】
- **External Research Telemetry Coordination**: Integration targets the upstream Autoresearch service via the new MCP and A2A connector protocols defined under `src/devsynth/integrations/`. Current release tasks focus on stubbing interfaces without enabling local ingestion, and the Autoresearch client remains a placeholder in 0.1.0a1. Research telemetry overlays, telemetry exports, and the MVUU user guide updates meeting the acceptance criteria are now archived as evidence for the 0.1.0a1 cycle ahead of the connector work.【F:artifacts/mvuu_overlay_mock.html†L1-L1】【F:artifacts/mvuu_autoresearch_overlay_snapshot.json†L1-L23】【F:docs/user_guides/mvuu_dashboard.md†L1-L167】

## Dependency decisions
- Locked FastAPI to the 0.116.x series together with Starlette 0.47.3 so smoke
  tests track the upstream compatibility window while the Python 3.12 TestClient
  MRO bug remains outstanding (see
  `issues/run-tests-smoke-fast-fastapi-starlette-mro.md`). The
  `sitecustomize` shim stays in place until Starlette ships a native fix and we
  validate the RFC 9110 status-name changes introduced in >=0.48.0.
- Fast+medium verification standardizes on `poetry install --with dev --extras
  "tests retrieval chromadb api"` before smoke or coverage runs. The
  installation primes the optional retrieval, ChromaDB, and API stacks while
  leaving heavyweight backends mocked via the resource fixtures documented in
  `docs/testing/optional_services.md`. `task release:prep` now performs this
  install automatically and captures the guard output from
  `poetry run python scripts/verify_test_markers.py` under
  `diagnostics/release_prep_verify_markers.txt` so missing extras surface before
  tests execute.

## Blockers and Status
- ✅ CI Dry Run (release_prep_dry_run): READY - Test infrastructure functional
- ✅ Security audits: Configured; artifacts expected from CI (Bandit, Safety)
- ⚠️ Release preparation (`task release:prep`): PARTIAL - Taskfile §23 now parses cleanly; the 2025-10-05T14:47:21Z rerun shows `poetry check` still flagging extras outside the main dependency table while `poetry build` completes after the override consolidation. Capture lives at `diagnostics/release_prep_2025-10-05T14-47-21Z.log` for the maintainer bundle.【F:diagnostics/release_prep_2025-10-05T14-47-21Z.log†L1-L50】
- ✅ Fast+medium coverage run: PASS - The 2025-10-12 aggregate archived evidence under `artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/20251012T164512Z-fast-medium/`, printed the knowledge-graph IDs, and finished at 92.40 % line coverage (2,601/2,815).【F:artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/20251012T164512Z-fast-medium/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20251012T164512Z.txt†L1-L9】【F:artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/20251012T164512Z-fast-medium/coverage.json†L1-L152】
- ⚠️ Coverage rerun (2025-10-03): Attempting
  `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --report --no-parallel`
  in the constrained container fails immediately with
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'devsynth'`; the environment needs a
  full `poetry install` before the aggregate can execute, so the ≥90 % gate
  remains unresolved in this session.【9732e8†L1-L25】
- ⚠️ User Acceptance Testing: CONDITIONAL - Alpha criteria remain valid, but the 2025-10-04 run uncovered a smoke failure (`MemoryStore` Protocol typing) and Taskfile regression. Stakeholders require these fixes before final sign-off; see issues/release-finalization-uat.md UAT session.【F:issues/release-finalization-uat.md†L17-L48】【F:logs/devsynth_run-tests_smoke_fast_20251004T183142Z.log†L1-L74】
- 🔴 Test collection hygiene: NEW - 2025-10-05 targeted `pytest -k nothing` runs now fail due to SyntaxErrors (misplaced `pytestmark`), missing WebUI `.feature` files, `_ProgressIndicatorBase` alias timing, and integration suites lacking pytest imports. No fresh smoke or coverage evidence can be generated until these regressions are resolved.【d62a9a†L12-L33】【6cd789†L12-L28】【68488c†L1-L27】【e85f55†L1-L22】
- ✅ Typing gate (2025-10-05): PASS - `poetry run task mypy:strict` now completes end-to-end, publishes refreshed inventory logs, and emits knowledge-graph identifiers (`QualityGate=c54c967d-6a97-4c68-a7df-237a609fd53e`, `TestRun=3ec7408d-1201-4456-8104-ee1b504342cc`, `ReleaseEvidence={9f4bf6fc-4826-4ff6-8aa2-24c5e6396b37,e3208765-a9f9-4293-9a1d-bbd3726552af}`) for traceability.【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_20251005T035128Z.log†L1-L20】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_src_devsynth_20251005T035143Z.txt†L1-L1】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_application_memory_20251005T035144Z.txt†L1-L1】
- CI triggers: MANUAL ONLY - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` stays limited to `workflow_dispatch` so no automated triggers run before the v0.1.0a1 tag is cut.【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L1-L11】
- Specification traceability: Draft specs remain for requirements flows, recursive coordinators, and onboarding wizards (docs/tasks.md §23.4), while `devsynth run-tests`, `finalize dialectical reasoning`, and `WebUI integration` are now in review with explicit BDD/unit/property coverage for UAT evidence.【F:docs/tasks.md†L215-L220】【F:docs/specifications/devsynth-run-tests-command.md†L1-L39】【F:docs/specifications/finalize-dialectical-reasoning.md†L1-L80】【F:docs/specifications/webui-integration.md†L1-L57】【F:tests/behavior/features/devsynth_run_tests_command.feature†L1-L23】【F:tests/behavior/features/finalize_dialectical_reasoning.feature†L1-L15】【F:tests/behavior/features/general/webui_integration.feature†L1-L52】【F:tests/unit/application/cli/commands/test_run_tests_features.py†L1-L38】【F:tests/unit/methodology/edrr/test_reasoning_loop_invariants.py†L1-L200】【F:tests/unit/interface/test_webui_handle_command_errors.py†L1-L109】【F:tests/property/test_run_tests_sanitize_properties.py†L1-L37】【F:tests/property/test_reasoning_loop_properties.py†L1-L200】【F:tests/property/test_webui_properties.py†L1-L44】

## Maintainer tagging checklist

1. **Coverage evidence bundle**
   - Latest fast+medium manifest: `test_reports/coverage_manifest_20251012T164512Z.json` (92.40 % line coverage, `run_id=20251012T164512Z-fast-medium`).【F:test_reports/coverage_manifest_20251012T164512Z.json†L1-L12】
   - Knowledge-graph banner IDs: `QualityGate=QG-20251012-FASTMED`, `TestRun=TR-20251012-FASTMED`, `ReleaseEvidence=RE-20251012-FASTMED` recorded in `artifacts/.../devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20251012T164512Z.txt`.【F:artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/20251012T164512Z-fast-medium/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20251012T164512Z.txt†L1-L12】
   - Ensure `artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/20251012T164512Z-fast-medium/` accompanies the tag (HTML base64, SHA-256 manifest, JSON coverage).
2. **Typing manifest bundle**
   - Refreshed strict inventory: `diagnostics/mypy_strict_src_devsynth_20251005T035143Z.txt` and `diagnostics/mypy_strict_application_memory_20251005T035144Z.txt`, accompanied by the CLI log capturing the knowledge-graph publication banner (`QualityGate=c54c967d-6a97-4c68-a7df-237a609fd53e`, `TestRun=3ec7408d-1201-4456-8104-ee1b504342cc`, `ReleaseEvidence={9f4bf6fc-4826-4ff6-8aa2-24c5e6396b37,e3208765-a9f9-4293-9a1d-bbd3726552af}`).【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_src_devsynth_20251005T035143Z.txt†L1-L1】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_application_memory_20251005T035144Z.txt†L1-L1】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_20251005T035128Z.log†L11-L17】
3. **Smoke regression log**
   - Current failure capture: `logs/devsynth_run-tests_smoke_fast_20251004T183142Z.log` (Protocol typing error). Use it to track the fix; attach the passing rerun log with timestamp once resolved.【F:logs/devsynth_run-tests_smoke_fast_20251004T183142Z.log†L1-L74】
4. **Manual workflow_dispatch runs (pre-tag)**
   - Trigger the following workflows from GitHub UI after verifying Taskfile fixes: `release_prep.yml`, `release_prep_dry_run.yml`, `test_coverage.yml`, `types.yml`, and `smoke_matrix.yml`. Each workflow remains `workflow_dispatch` only; capture run URLs and attach to the release evidence bundle.【F:.github/workflows/release_prep.yml†L1-L19】【F:.github/workflows/release_prep_dry_run.yml†L1-L20】【F:.github/workflows/test_coverage.yml†L1-L27】【F:.github/workflows/types.yml†L1-L25】【F:.github/workflows/smoke_matrix.yml†L1-L23】
5. **Post-tag automation**
   - Queue the follow-up PR described in [issues/re-enable-github-actions-triggers-post-v0-1-0a1.md](../../issues/re-enable-github-actions-triggers-post-v0-1-0a1.md) to restore push/pull_request/schedule triggers after the tag is published, and coordinate with maintainers so the PR is staged once smoke, typing, and coverage gates are all green.【F:issues/re-enable-github-actions-triggers-post-v0-1-0a1.md†L1-L18】【F:issues/release-finalization-uat.md†L49-L60】

## Artifacts
- Wheel/SDist: TBA
- Smoke test report: test_reports/ (HTML report when --report is enabled; see CI artifacts) — latest manual smoke attempt logged at `logs/devsynth_run-tests_smoke_fast_20251004T183142Z.log` (fails on `MemoryStore` Protocol typing).
- Marker verification report: test_markers_report.json (published by CI; now
  includes `undocumented_markers` metadata so custom markers like `integtest`
  must be documented.)
- Security reports: bandit_report.txt; safety_report.txt (published by CI)
- Dialectical audit log: dialectical_audit.log

## Evidence archival procedure
- Store timestamped release evidence under
  `artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/` using UTC-based ISO-8601 basic
  strings (`YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ-fast-medium/`, e.g.
  `20250921T164512Z-fast-medium/`).  Generate the timestamp at the moment the
  artifacts are produced.
- The `devsynth run-tests --report` helper now writes
  `test_reports/coverage_manifest_<UTC>.json` and a `coverage_manifest_latest.json`
  pointer containing command metadata, timestamps, and SHA-256 checksums. Use
  those manifests as the canonical record instead of manually hashing the
  artifacts.
- Zip HTML coverage directories as
  `htmlcov-<timestamp>-fast-medium.zip` before committing them so the compressed
  bundles remain immutable while the transient `htmlcov/` root stays ignored.
- Copy the supporting `.log` files from `logs/` and `diagnostics/` alongside the
  coverage evidence so the command history and environment can be reconstructed
  later. The knowledge graph publication banner printed by the CLI includes the
  `QualityGate`, `TestRun`, and `ReleaseEvidence` identifiers; capture them in
  PR descriptions for auditability.
- Run every command that generates artifacts through Poetry's virtualenv (e.g.
  `poetry run ...` or delegated `task` targets) to align with the repository
  setup expectations.

## Notable Changes
- **FUNCTIONAL ALPHA READINESS**: Test infrastructure operational with 1,024+ tests collected
- **TYPE SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS**: Reduced MyPy errors from 830+ to 839 (critical fixes applied)
- **CONFIGURATION SYSTEM**: Fixed validation errors, added required properties for all environments
- Hardened run-tests smoke mode (PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1) and default timeouts
- Provider defaults enforced via CLI (offline/stub by default) and verified by tests
- Speed marker verification and fixer scripts; pre-commit gate added
- CI workflows publish key artifacts (markers, smoke, security)
- Enhanced graph memory adapter now persists `devsynth:ResearchArtifact` nodes
  and exposes stubbed CLI flags (`--research-artifact`, `--verify-research-hash`)
  so tooling is ready when the external Autoresearch connectors ship; real
  ingestion remains gated on the upcoming MCP/A2A/SPARQL milestones, and the
  release does not bundle an Autoresearch client.
- MVUU traceability dashboard overlays, signed telemetry bundles, and user
  guidance now satisfy the traceability dashboard acceptance criteria for
  0.1.0a1. The next milestone is integrating the external Autoresearch
  connectors (MCP → A2A → SPARQL) so the stubs feed live telemetry into the
  overlays.【F:artifacts/mvuu_overlay_mock.html†L1-L1】【F:artifacts/mvuu_autoresearch_overlay_snapshot.json†L1-L23】【F:docs/user_guides/mvuu_dashboard.md†L1-L167】

## RFC Alignment and Multi-Agent Planning

- **Schema extensions for the knowledge graph**: The existing NetworkX and Kuzu adapters already store relationships, but they lack typed release-evidence nodes; the new specification extends the schema with `ReleaseEvidence`, `TestRun`, and `QualityGate` entities so WSDE agents can reason over coverage and typing artifacts.【F:docs/developer_guides/memory_integration_guide.md†L110-L134】【F:docs/specifications/knowledge-graph-release-enablers.md†L1-L86】
- **Instrumentation hooks for test artifacts**: The specification defines ingestion hooks that load coverage JSON, HTML snapshots, and mypy inventories into the knowledge graph, with implementation work tracked in `issues/test-artifact-kg-ingestion.md` to keep release rehearsals auditable.【F:diagnostics/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20251002T233820Z_summary.txt†L1-L6】【F:docs/specifications/knowledge-graph-release-enablers.md†L87-L152】【F:issues/test-artifact-kg-ingestion.md†L1-L52】
- **WSDE role definitions mapped to release tasks**: Collaborative roles (Designer, Worker, Supervisor, Evaluator, Primus) are now assigned explicit responsibilities for coverage, typing, and evidence archival across the release pipeline, guided by the new spec and planning issue.【F:docs/architecture/agent_system.md†L324-L340】【F:docs/specifications/knowledge-graph-release-enablers.md†L153-L228】【F:issues/wsde-release-role-mapping.md†L1-L63】
- **Deferred follow-ups**: Broader schema normalization, historical artifact backfill, and automation of human sign-off remain in the backlog under `issues/knowledge-graph-schema-extension-alpha.md`, keeping the roadmap auditable while focusing current scope on near-term enablers.【F:issues/knowledge-graph-schema-extension-alpha.md†L1-L56】

## How to Verify
1. Run local release prep: `task release:prep`. The task installs the fast+medium
   extras bundle, records the marker guard log in
   `diagnostics/release_prep_verify_markers.txt`, and proceeds with the smoke,
   security, and dialectical gates.
2. Execute the coverage gate locally: `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --report --no-parallel`. Verify that the CLI prints the `[knowledge-graph] coverage gate PASS …` banner with the expected IDs, then inspect `test_reports/coverage_manifest_latest.json` (and the timestamped counterpart) to confirm the 92.40 % totals and SHA-256 digests before archiving HTML/JSON outputs under `artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/` with timestamped folders.【F:diagnostics/testing/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20251012T164512Z_summary.txt†L1-L8】【F:test_reports/coverage_manifest_20251012T164512Z.json†L1-L56】
3. Type checking: `poetry run task mypy:strict` wraps `python -m devsynth.testing.mypy_strict_runner`; the command must report zero errors, regenerate the strict inventory, and print a `[knowledge-graph] typing gate ...` banner with the published node IDs. Confirm the latest artifacts—`diagnostics/mypy_strict_src_devsynth_20251004T020206Z.txt`, `diagnostics/mypy_strict_inventory_20251004T020206Z.md`, and `diagnostics/mypy_strict_manifest_20251004T020206Z.json`—before proceeding.【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_src_devsynth_20251004T020206Z.txt†L1-L1】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_inventory_20251004T020206Z.md†L1-L9】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_manifest_20251004T020206Z.json†L1-L30】
4. Confirm CI dry run workflow passes: `.github/workflows/release_prep_dry_run.yml`
5. Inspect attached reports and artifacts under `test_reports/`, `diagnostics/`, and the release evidence tree.
