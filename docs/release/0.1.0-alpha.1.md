# DevSynth 0.1.0-alpha.1

## Installing go-task

Install the `go-task` runner if it's missing and confirm tooling is ready:

```bash
bash scripts/install_dev.sh
poetry env info --path
task --version
```

This ensures Taskfile targets are available and Poetry manages a virtual environment during release preparation.

## Setup

1. Run the environment provisioning script to install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/install_dev.sh
   ```
2. Install dependencies with development and test extras:
   ```bash
   poetry install --with dev --extras tests retrieval chromadb api
   ```
   The repository commits a `poetry.toml` that enforces `virtualenvs.create=true`.
   Verify the virtual environment path is non-empty:
   ```bash
   poetry env info --path
   ```
3. Execute repository checks:
   ```bash
   PIP_NO_INDEX=1 poetry run pip check
   poetry run pre-commit run --files <changed>
   poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast
   poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=medium
   poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=slow
   poetry run python tests/verify_test_organization.py
   poetry run python scripts/verify_test_markers.py
   poetry run python scripts/verify_requirements_traceability.py
   poetry run python scripts/verify_version_sync.py
   ```
   The marker verification step caches pytest collection results in `.pytest_collection_cache.json` and accepts `--changed` to inspect only paths reported by `git diff --name-only`.
4. Validate deployment configuration:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest tests/unit/deployment -m fast
   ```
5. Prepare release artifacts with Taskfile and run the dialectical audit:
   ```bash
   task --version
   task release:prep
   ```
   Record all audit questions and their resolutions in `dialectical_audit.log`.

6. Verify the repository is in a release-ready state:
   ```bash
   poetry run python scripts/verify_release_state.py
   ```
   Tagging must only occur after this check passes and all audit questions in `dialectical_audit.log` are resolved.
  Review the log with another contributor before tagging the release.
  See the [Dialectical Audit Policy](../policies/dialectical_audit.md) for guidance.

## Checklist Results

The following commands were executed for this release:

```bash
PIP_NO_INDEX=1 poetry run pip check
poetry run pre-commit run --files <changed>
poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast
poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=medium
poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=slow
poetry run python tests/verify_test_organization.py
poetry run python scripts/verify_test_markers.py
poetry run python scripts/verify_requirements_traceability.py
poetry run python scripts/verify_version_sync.py
task --version
task release:prep
```

Commands executed; test-marker verification and release preparation reported issues. See Known P1 Issues.
## Post-Tag Version Bump
After tagging, run `poetry version 0.1.0-alpha.2.dev0` (or appropriate next version) and commit.



## Features

- Modular, hexagonal architecture
- Unified memory system with multiple backends
- Agent system powered by LangGraph
- Advanced code analysis using NetworkX
- Provider abstraction for LLM services
- Comprehensive SDLC policy corpus
- Automated documentation and testing
- Recursive EDRR framework implementation
- Documentation cleansing and organization
- Behavior-driven tests for the EDRR coordinator
- Basic security utilities for authentication, authorization, and input sanitization
- Doctor command for configuration validation
- Anthropic API support and deterministic offline provider implementation
- MVUU engine for tracking Minimum Viable Utility Units
- Atomic-Rewrite workflow for granular commit generation

## Green Criteria

- All CI workflows pass.
- `PIP_NO_INDEX=1 poetry run pip check` succeeds in offline mode.
- `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast` completes without unexpected failures.

## Known P1 Issues and Test Gaps

The following issues were identified during the `0.1.0-alpha.1` release cycle:
- `poetry run python scripts/verify_test_markers.py` fails due to pytest collection errors in several test modules (e.g., `tests/performance/test_api_benchmarks.py`, `tests/behavior/test_agentapi.py`).
- A committed `poetry.toml` sets `virtualenvs.create=true` to ensure the `devsynth` CLI is available; verify `poetry env info --path` returns a path.
- `poetry run python scripts/verify_test_markers.py` now caches pytest collection results per file and supports `--changed` to inspect only modified paths. With caching, full verification runs in under 30 seconds.

## Looking Ahead
