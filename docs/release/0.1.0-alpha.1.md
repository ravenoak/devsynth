# DevSynth 0.1.0-alpha.1

## Setup

1. Run the environment provisioning script to install dependencies and ensure `go-task` is available:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/install_dev.sh
   ```
2. Install dependencies with development and test extras:
   ```bash
   poetry install --with dev --extras tests retrieval chromadb api
   ```
3. Execute repository checks:
   ```bash
   PIP_NO_INDEX=1 poetry run pip check
   poetry run pre-commit run --files <changed>
   poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast
   poetry run python tests/verify_test_organization.py
   poetry run python scripts/verify_test_markers.py
   poetry run python scripts/verify_requirements_traceability.py
   poetry run python scripts/verify_version_sync.py
   ```
4. Validate deployment configuration:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest tests/unit/deployment -m fast
   ```
5. Prepare release artifacts with Taskfile and run the dialectical audit:
   ```bash
   poetry run task release:prep
   poetry run python scripts/dialectical_audit.py
   ```
   Record all audit questions and their resolutions in `dialectical_audit.log`.
   Review the log with another contributor before tagging the release.
   See the [Dialectical Audit Policy](../policies/dialectical_audit.md) for guidance.


## Post-tagging

After tagging the release, bump to the next development version and commit:

```bash
poetry version 0.1.0-alpha.2.dev0
git commit -am "chore: start 0.1.0-alpha.2.dev0"
```

## Features

- Modular, hexagonal architecture
- Unified memory system with multiple backends
- Agent system powered by LangGraph
- Advanced code analysis using NetworkX
- Provider abstraction for LLM services
- Comprehensive SDLC policy corpus
- Automated documentation and testing
- Recursive EDRR framework implementation
- Documentation cleansing and organization
- Behavior-driven tests for the EDRR coordinator
- Basic security utilities for authentication, authorization, and input sanitization
- Doctor command for configuration validation
- Anthropic API support and deterministic offline provider implementation
- MVUU engine for tracking Minimum Viable Utility Units
- Atomic-Rewrite workflow for granular commit generation

## Green Criteria

- All CI workflows pass.
- `PIP_NO_INDEX=1 poetry run pip check` succeeds in offline mode.
- `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast` completes without unexpected failures.

## Known P1 Issues and Test Gaps

The following issues were identified during the `0.1.0-alpha.1` release cycle:

- `poetry run python scripts/verify_test_markers.py` fails due to pytest collection errors in several test modules (e.g., `tests/performance/test_api_benchmarks.py`, `tests/behavior/test_agentapi.py`).
