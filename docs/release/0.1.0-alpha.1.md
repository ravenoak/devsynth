# DevSynth 0.1.0-alpha.1

## Setup

1. Run the environment provisioning script.
2. Install dependencies with development and test extras:
   ```bash
   poetry install --with dev --extras tests retrieval chromadb api
   ```
3. Execute repository checks:
   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit run --files <changed>
   poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast
   poetry run python tests/verify_test_organization.py
   poetry run python scripts/verify_test_markers.py
   poetry run python scripts/verify_requirements_traceability.py
   poetry run python scripts/verify_version_sync.py
   ```
4. Validate deployment configuration:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest tests/unit/deployment -m fast
   ```

## Features

- Added `devsynth mvu exec` to run shell commands with combined output capture.

## Green Criteria

- All CI workflows pass.
- `PIP_NO_INDEX=1 poetry run pip check` succeeds in offline mode.
- `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast` completes without unexpected failures.

## Known P1 Issues and Test Gaps

The following issues were identified during the `0.1.0-alpha.1` release cycle:

- WSDE/EDRR integration suites fail ([Issue 112](../../issues/WSDE-collaboration-test-failures.md)) – open.
- Kuzu-backed memory store fails to initialise during tests ([Issue 113](../../issues/archived/Kuzu-memory-integration-errors.md)) – archived.
- Requirements wizard logging and persistence errors break integration tests ([Issue 114](../../issues/archived/Requirements-wizard-failures.md)) – archived.
- Full test suite terminates early with multiple unit failures ([Issue 116](../../issues/archived/Multiple-test-failures-and-suite-termination.md)) – archived.
