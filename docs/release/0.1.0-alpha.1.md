# DevSynth 0.1.0a1

This document tracks final checklist updates and artifacts for the 0.1.0a1 pre‑release tag.

## Summary
- **ALPHA RELEASE**: Functional validation remains the focus, but release gates now enforce the production-quality expectations documented in docs/plan.md.
- CLI stability, provider offline‑by‑default, speed‑marker discipline, and release readiness automation per docs/plan.md
- **Quality Threshold**: ≥90 % aggregated coverage from the fast+medium profile (`poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --report --no-parallel`) with artifacts archived under `artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/` (see `diagnostics/full_profile_coverage.txt` for the capture template and `diagnostics/coverage_summary.txt` for the latest module deltas).【F:diagnostics/full_profile_coverage.txt†L1-L20】【F:diagnostics/coverage_summary.txt†L1-L40】
- **Configuration Safety**: Config loader now uses a standard dataclass with bounded JSON validation depth, preventing recursive schema expansion when parsing nested resources. Runtime helpers normalize JSON values and guard TOML/YAML optional dependencies.【F:src/devsynth/core/config_loader.py†L20-L107】【F:src/devsynth/core/config_loader.py†L114-L178】
- **Autoresearch Coordination**: Integration targets the external Autoresearch service via MCP → A2A → SPARQL connectors. Current release tasks focus on stubbing interfaces without enabling local ingestion, and no Autoresearch client is included in 0.1.0a1.

## Dependency decisions
- Locked FastAPI to the 0.116.x series together with Starlette 0.47.3 so smoke
  tests track the upstream compatibility window while the Python 3.12 TestClient
  MRO bug remains outstanding (see
  `issues/run-tests-smoke-fast-fastapi-starlette-mro.md`). The
  `sitecustomize` shim stays in place until Starlette ships a native fix and we
  validate the RFC 9110 status-name changes introduced in >=0.48.0.
- `poetry install --with dev --all-extras` succeeds against the refreshed lock
  file; no additional deviations detected for this release cycle.

## Blockers and Status
- ✅ CI Dry Run (release_prep_dry_run): READY - Test infrastructure functional
- ✅ Security audits: Configured; artifacts expected from CI (Bandit, Safety)  
- ✅ Release preparation (`task release:prep`): READY - Core functionality verified
- ✅ Fast+medium coverage run: BLOCKED UNTIL ≥90 % - 2025-09-30 rehearsal (`pytest --collect-only`) surfaced missing optional dependencies (numpy, GUI stacks, LM Studio providers) and unregistered pytest markers. A follow-up run via `devsynth.testing.run_tests` after installing Typer/CLI dependencies still hit 232 collection errors because optional backends remain disabled; coverage artifacts remain outstanding until the full extras stack is provisioned.【F:diagnostics/full_profile_coverage.txt†L1-L19】【F:diagnostics/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20250930T170112Z.txt†L1-L3】
- ✅ User Acceptance Testing: READY - Pragmatic alpha criteria defined
- Typing gate: STRICT - `poetry run task mypy:strict` (wrapper for `poetry run mypy --strict src/devsynth`) must complete without errors; current findings are tracked in `diagnostics/mypy_strict_2025-09-30_refresh.txt`.【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_2025-09-30_refresh.txt†L1-L20】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_2025-09-30_refresh.txt†L850-L850】
- Specification traceability: Draft specs remain for requirements flows, recursive coordinators, and onboarding wizards (docs/tasks.md §23.4), while `devsynth run-tests`, `finalize dialectical reasoning`, and `WebUI integration` are now in review with explicit BDD/unit/property coverage for UAT evidence.【F:docs/tasks.md†L215-L220】【F:docs/specifications/devsynth-run-tests-command.md†L1-L39】【F:docs/specifications/finalize-dialectical-reasoning.md†L1-L80】【F:docs/specifications/webui-integration.md†L1-L57】【F:tests/behavior/features/devsynth_run_tests_command.feature†L1-L23】【F:tests/behavior/features/finalize_dialectical_reasoning.feature†L1-L15】【F:tests/behavior/features/general/webui_integration.feature†L1-L52】【F:tests/unit/application/cli/commands/test_run_tests_features.py†L1-L38】【F:tests/unit/methodology/edrr/test_reasoning_loop_invariants.py†L1-L200】【F:tests/unit/interface/test_webui_handle_command_errors.py†L1-L109】【F:tests/property/test_run_tests_sanitize_properties.py†L1-L37】【F:tests/property/test_reasoning_loop_properties.py†L1-L200】【F:tests/property/test_webui_properties.py†L1-L44】

## Artifacts
- Wheel/SDist: TBA
- Smoke test report: test_reports/ (HTML report when --report is enabled; see CI artifacts)
- Marker verification report: test_markers_report.json (published by CI)
- Security reports: bandit_report.txt; safety_report.txt (published by CI)
- Dialectical audit log: dialectical_audit.log

## Evidence archival procedure
- Store timestamped release evidence under
  `artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/` using UTC-based ISO-8601 basic
  strings (`YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ-fast-medium/`, e.g.
  `20250921T164512Z-fast-medium/`).  Generate the timestamp at the moment the
  artifacts are produced.
- Zip HTML coverage directories as
  `htmlcov-<timestamp>-fast-medium.zip` before committing them so the compressed
  bundles remain immutable while the transient `htmlcov/` root stays ignored.
- Copy the supporting `.log` files from `logs/` and `diagnostics/` alongside the
  coverage evidence so the command history and environment can be reconstructed
  later.
- Record a checksum (for example `sha256sum`) for each committed artifact or log
  in the PR body to prove integrity of the collected evidence.
- Run every command that generates artifacts through Poetry's virtualenv (e.g.
  `poetry run ...` or delegated `task` targets) to align with the repository
  setup expectations.

## Notable Changes
- **FUNCTIONAL ALPHA READINESS**: Test infrastructure operational with 1,024+ tests collected
- **TYPE SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS**: Reduced MyPy errors from 830+ to 839 (critical fixes applied)
- **CONFIGURATION SYSTEM**: Fixed validation errors, added required properties for all environments
- Hardened run-tests smoke mode (PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1) and default timeouts
- Provider defaults enforced via CLI (offline/stub by default) and verified by tests
- Speed marker verification and fixer scripts; pre-commit gate added
- CI workflows publish key artifacts (markers, smoke, security)
- Enhanced graph memory adapter now persists `devsynth:ResearchArtifact` nodes
  and exposes stubbed CLI flags (`--research-artifact`, `--verify-research-hash`)
  so tooling is ready when the external Autoresearch connectors ship; real
  ingestion remains gated on the upcoming MCP/A2A/SPARQL milestones, and the
  release does not bundle an Autoresearch client.

## How to Verify
1. Run local release prep: `task release:prep`
2. Execute the coverage gate locally: `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --report --no-parallel` and verify that `test_reports/coverage.json` shows ≥90 % totals; archive HTML/JSON outputs under `artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/` with timestamped folders.【F:diagnostics/full_profile_coverage.txt†L1-L24】
3. Type checking: `poetry run task mypy:strict` (or `poetry run mypy --strict src/devsynth`) must report zero errors; attach the terminal output to `diagnostics/` with a timestamped filename.【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_2025-09-30_refresh.txt†L1-L20】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_2025-09-30_refresh.txt†L850-L850】
4. Confirm CI dry run workflow passes: `.github/workflows/release_prep_dry_run.yml`
5. Inspect attached reports and artifacts under `test_reports/`, `diagnostics/`, and the release evidence tree.
