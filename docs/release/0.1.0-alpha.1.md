# DevSynth 0.1.0a1

This document tracks final checklist updates and artifacts for the 0.1.0a1 pre‑release tag.

## Summary
- Focus on CLI stability, provider offline‑by‑default, speed‑marker discipline, and release readiness automation per docs/plan.md.

## Dependency decisions
- Locked FastAPI to the 0.116.x series together with Starlette 0.47.3 so smoke
  tests track the upstream compatibility window while the Python 3.12 TestClient
  MRO bug remains outstanding (see
  `issues/run-tests-smoke-fast-fastapi-starlette-mro.md`). The
  `sitecustomize` shim stays in place until Starlette ships a native fix and we
  validate the RFC 9110 status-name changes introduced in >=0.48.0.
- `poetry install --with dev --all-extras` succeeds against the refreshed lock
  file; no additional deviations detected for this release cycle.

## Blockers and Status
- CI Dry Run (release_prep_dry_run): Pending confirmation on main
- Security audits: Configured; artifacts expected from CI (Bandit, Safety)
- Release preparation (`task release:prep`): Pending local confirmation
- Final full fast+medium coverage run: Pending
- User Acceptance Testing: Pending
- Specification traceability: Draft specs remain for requirements flows, recursive coordinators, and onboarding wizards (docs/tasks.md §23.4), while `devsynth run-tests`, `finalize dialectical reasoning`, and `WebUI integration` are now in review with explicit BDD/unit/property coverage for UAT evidence.【F:docs/tasks.md†L215-L220】【F:docs/specifications/devsynth-run-tests-command.md†L1-L39】【F:docs/specifications/finalize-dialectical-reasoning.md†L1-L80】【F:docs/specifications/webui-integration.md†L1-L57】【F:tests/behavior/features/devsynth_run_tests_command.feature†L1-L23】【F:tests/behavior/features/finalize_dialectical_reasoning.feature†L1-L15】【F:tests/behavior/features/general/webui_integration.feature†L1-L52】【F:tests/unit/application/cli/commands/test_run_tests_features.py†L1-L38】【F:tests/unit/methodology/edrr/test_reasoning_loop_invariants.py†L1-L200】【F:tests/unit/interface/test_webui_handle_command_errors.py†L1-L109】【F:tests/property/test_run_tests_sanitize_properties.py†L1-L37】【F:tests/property/test_reasoning_loop_properties.py†L1-L200】【F:tests/property/test_webui_properties.py†L1-L44】

## Artifacts
- Wheel/SDist: TBA
- Smoke test report: test_reports/ (HTML report when --report is enabled; see CI artifacts)
- Marker verification report: test_markers_report.json (published by CI)
- Security reports: bandit_report.txt; safety_report.txt (published by CI)
- Dialectical audit log: dialectical_audit.log

## Evidence archival procedure
- Store timestamped release evidence under
  `artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/` using UTC-based ISO-8601 basic
  strings (`YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ-fast-medium/`, e.g.
  `20250921T164512Z-fast-medium/`).  Generate the timestamp at the moment the
  artifacts are produced.
- Zip HTML coverage directories as
  `htmlcov-<timestamp>-fast-medium.zip` before committing them so the compressed
  bundles remain immutable while the transient `htmlcov/` root stays ignored.
- Copy the supporting `.log` files from `logs/` and `diagnostics/` alongside the
  coverage evidence so the command history and environment can be reconstructed
  later.
- Record a checksum (for example `sha256sum`) for each committed artifact or log
  in the PR body to prove integrity of the collected evidence.
- Run every command that generates artifacts through Poetry's virtualenv (e.g.
  `poetry run ...` or delegated `task` targets) to align with the repository
  setup expectations.

## Notable Changes
- Hardened run-tests smoke mode (PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1) and default timeouts
- Provider defaults enforced via CLI (offline/stub by default) and verified by tests
- Speed marker verification and fixer scripts; pre-commit gate added
- CI workflows publish key artifacts (markers, smoke, security)

## How to Verify
1. Run local release prep: `task release:prep`
2. Confirm CI dry run workflow passes: `.github/workflows/release_prep_dry_run.yml`
3. Inspect attached reports and artifacts under test_reports/ and root-level JSON/TXT artifacts
