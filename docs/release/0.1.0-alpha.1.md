# DevSynth 0.1.0-alpha.1

## Setup

1. Run `deployment/bootstrap_env.sh`:
   ```bash
   ./deployment/bootstrap_env.sh
   ```
2. Install dependencies with development and test extras:
   ```bash
   poetry install --with dev --extras "tests retrieval chromadb api"
   ```
3. Execute repository checks:
   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit run --files <changed>
   poetry run devsynth run-tests
   poetry run python tests/verify_test_organization.py
   ```

## Green Criteria

- All CI workflows pass.
- `PIP_NO_INDEX=1 poetry run pip check` succeeds in offline mode.
- `poetry run devsynth run-tests` completes without unexpected failures.

## Known P1 Issues and Test Gaps

- WSDE/EDRR integration suites fail ([Issue 112](../../issues/112.md)).
- Kuzu-backed memory store fails to initialise during tests ([Issue 113](../../issues/113.md)).
- Requirements wizard logging and persistence errors break integration tests ([Issue 114](../../issues/114.md)).
- Full test suite terminates early with multiple unit failures ([Issue 116](../../issues/116.md)).
