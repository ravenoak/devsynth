# DevSynth v0.1.0a1 Execution Plan (Updated 2025-10-02)

## Purpose
This document synthesizes the RFC proposal, current diagnostics, and dialectical + Socratic analysis to determine the highest-impact work required before tagging v0.1.0a1. It identifies which RFC initiatives are in-scope for the alpha tag, organizes them into actionable pull requests, and clarifies sequencing and parallelization constraints. The plan assumes no TestPyPI activity per maintainer directive.

## Evidence Baseline (2025-10-02 UTC)
- `poetry run mypy --strict src/devsynth` reports 794 errors across 82 files (see `diagnostics/mypy_strict_2025-09-30_refresh.txt`).
- Fast + medium coverage sweep fails the ≥90% threshold with 20.92 % measured coverage (see `diagnostics/full_profile_coverage.txt`).
- Behavior/Bdd suites exist but lack executable coverage gates for the newest features (per `docs/plan.md` diagnostics log and `test_markers_report.json`).
- RFC focus areas extend beyond alpha scope; not all should be attempted pre-tag.

## Dialectical Evaluation of RFC Scope
- **Thesis (Ambitious Adoption):** Implement the full RFC (knowledge graph expansion, multi-agent rotation, UI, compliance engine) now to align alpha with long-term vision.
- **Antithesis (Pragmatic Release):** Attempting the full RFC now would prolong the alpha indefinitely; strict typing and coverage already block the release.
- **Synthesis (Targeted Execution):** For v0.1.0a1 prioritize infrastructure that directly affects reliability metrics (typing, coverage, tests, traceability) and leave heavyweight platform upgrades for post-alpha follow-up. RFC elements that provide immediate validation, traceability, or gating remain in-scope; exploratory UX and large-scale backends are deferred.

## Socratic Cross-Examination
1. **What is the release-blocking problem?** Mypy strict failure, sub-90 % coverage, and missing behavior coverage audit trails undermine confidence in the alpha tag.
2. **What proofs confirm remediation?** Passing `poetry run mypy --strict src/devsynth`, ≥90 % aggregate coverage with reproducible artifacts, and updated traceability + behavior reports captured in `test_reports/` and docs.
3. **What resources do we control?** Existing modular tests, diagnostics logs, in-repo issue tracker, and ability to add focused specs/tests without TestPyPI.
4. **Which RFC items produce measurable release impact?** Strengthening typing, coverage instrumentation, WSDE coordination scripts, and traceability dashboards deliver direct release metrics; Web UI explorers or new backends do not.
5. **What stops us from executing now?** Lack of prioritized ownership, absence of dependency graph for fixes, and outdated issue status implying readiness.

## High-Impact Objectives (Pre-Tag)
1. **Restore strict typing compliance** for `src/devsynth` with sustainable stubs and targeted refactors.
2. **Raise combined fast+medium coverage to ≥90 %** via targeted tests for low-coverage modules and verifying instrumentation.
3. **Guarantee behavior and property coverage** with executable specs that mirror new requirements.
4. **Stabilize WSDE multi-agent workflows** that feed coverage/typing status into planning (automation scripts + documentation updates).
5. **Refresh traceability + documentation** so issues, specs, and diagnostics reflect current blockers and planned remedies.

## Pull Request Work Breakdown
| PR | Goal | Key Tasks | Dependencies | Parallelizable? |
|----|------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **PR-1:** Diagnostics Realignment & Issue Corrections | Update release readiness docs/issues to reflect actual blockers; add dashboards for typing/coverage debt. | - Update `issues/v0-1-0a1-highest-impact-changes-summary.md` with current status and metrics.<br>- Publish strict typing & coverage debt snapshots (link existing diagnostics).<br>- Document RFC evaluation + prioritized scope (this file). | None | Can start immediately; unblock planning conversations. |
| **PR-2:** Strict Typing Remediation Sprint (Wave 1) | Reduce mypy strict errors by focusing on top-offenders modules (e.g., `application/cli`, `testing/run_tests`, `core/config_loader`). | - Establish per-module TODO in `docs/typing/`.<br>- Apply targeted type annotations, generics fixes, stub updates.<br>- Ensure `poetry run mypy --strict src/devsynth/application src/devsynth/testing` passes.<br>- Add regression tests where signatures change. | PR-1 (ensures authoritative plan + ownership). | Parallelizable with PR-3 once module ownership assigned; dependent teams can work on disjoint modules. |
| **PR-3:** Coverage Uplift Sprint (Wave 1) | Increase line coverage for modules below 50 % (CLI commands, logging setup, provider adapters). | - Add focused unit/integration tests guided by diagnostics.<br>- Validate `poetry run devsynth run-tests --target all-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --no-parallel --report` reaches ≥60 % interim target.<br>- Ensure new tests follow marker discipline and property/behavior gating. | PR-1 (shared plan + metrics). | Parallelizable with PR-2; coordinate to avoid touching same modules simultaneously. |
| **PR-4:** Behavior & Property Spec Hardening | Ensure BDD scenarios and property tests trace to requirements and contribute to coverage. | - Draft/update specs under `docs/specifications/` for prioritized behavior gaps.<br>- Add/repair `tests/behavior/...` and `tests/property/...` to align with new specs.<br>- Update `scripts/verify_requirements_traceability.py` data sources if needed.<br>- Confirm behavior tests counted in coverage by CLI runs. | PR-1, plus partial outputs from PR-2/3 when specs refer to newly typed modules. | Partially parallel: spec drafting can begin after PR-1; final behavior tests may depend on refactors landing in PR-2/3. |
| **PR-5:** Final Compliance Gate | Achieve release criteria across repo. | - Ensure `poetry run mypy --strict src/devsynth` passes.<br>- Achieve ≥90 % coverage in fast+medium aggregate.<br>- Regenerate release notes + readiness checklist.<br>- Capture CLI + diagnostics evidence in docs.<br>- Update `docs/release/0.1.0-alpha.1.md` with final steps. | PR-2, PR-3, PR-4 completion. | Not parallel; final integration step. |

## Parallelization Notes
- PR-2 and PR-3 can proceed concurrently after PR-1 since they target different layers (typing vs. testing). Use coordination doc to avoid merge conflicts on shared files.
- PR-4 spec drafting can occur during PR-2/3, but final merges wait until code/test changes stabilize.
- PR-5 is inherently sequential, performing the final gate once other sprints succeed.

## Task Board Snapshot
- `docs/typing/strict_typing_wave1.md` (to be created) — enumerates targeted modules, owners, error counts, and fix approaches.
- `docs/testing/coverage_wave1.md` (to be created) — maps low-coverage modules to planned tests and responsible engineers.
- Update `docs/tasks.md` §21 with new subtasks referencing PR numbers and diagnostics.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Typing:** `poetry run mypy --strict src/devsynth` returns exit code 0 with updated suppressions documented.
2. **Testing:** Fast+medium aggregate via CLI meets ≥90 % coverage, leaving artifacts in `htmlcov/` and `test_reports/`.
3. **Behavior Specs:** All new/updated specs link to BDD features, each test includes one speed marker, and property tests run under `DEVSYNTH_PROPERTY_TESTING=true`.
4. **Documentation:** Issues, release docs, and traceability matrices accurately reflect remaining work and completed items.
5. **Dialectical Audit:** `dialectical_audit.log` receives an entry summarizing the synthesis reached in this plan.

## Immediate Next Steps (Action Items)
1. Merge PR-1 updates (this plan + issue corrections) to establish authoritative baseline.
2. Kick off typing and coverage sprints with dedicated owners per module/test file.
3. Schedule daily sync to review diagnostics outputs and adjust focus areas.
4. Prepare release readiness dashboard updates for PR-5 validation.
