# DevSynth v0.1.0a1 Execution Plan (Updated 2025-10-07T01:07Z)

## Purpose
This document synthesizes the RFC proposal, current diagnostics, and dialectical + Socratic analysis to determine the highest-impact work required before tagging v0.1.0a1. It identifies which RFC initiatives are in-scope for the alpha tag, organizes them into actionable pull requests, and clarifies sequencing and parallelization constraints. The plan assumes no TestPyPI activity per maintainer directive and keeps every GitHub Actions workflow on `workflow_dispatch` until human maintainers cut the tag.【F:docs/tasks.md†L365-L372】【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L1-L11】

## Evidence Baseline (2025-10-07T01:07Z UTC)
- **Plugin stability restored:** `pytest --collect-only -q` completed cleanly on 2025-10-07 after hoisting plugin exports,
  confirming PR-0 is complete and establishing a reliable baseline for follow-up hygiene work.【F:logs/pytest_collect_only_20251007.log†L1-L40】
- `task release:prep` now runs until `poetry build` hits the duplicate `overrides` keys in `pyproject.toml`, while `task mypy:strict` succeeds, publishes refreshed manifests, and records knowledge-graph identifiers (`QualityGate=c54c967d-6a97-4c68-a7df-237a609fd53e`, `TestRun=3ec7408d-1201-4456-8104-ee1b504342cc`, `ReleaseEvidence={9f4bf6fc-4826-4ff6-8aa2-24c5e6396b37,e3208765-a9f9-4293-9a1d-bbd3726552af}`); §23 literal blocks plus the `task lint:taskfile` dry-run (`task -n maintainer:must-run`) keep go-task parsing clean.【F:diagnostics/release_prep_20251005T035109Z.log†L1-L25】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_20251005T035128Z.log†L1-L20】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_src_devsynth_20251005T035143Z.txt†L1-L1】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_application_memory_20251005T035144Z.txt†L1-L1】【F:Taskfile.yml†L561-L668】【F:Taskfile.yml†L669-L681】
- Smoke-mode `poetry run devsynth run-tests --smoke --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1` times out during collection fallback and then fails on the `MemoryStore` Protocol generics error, preventing coverage artifacts from being generated and halting behavior verification.【F:logs/devsynth_run-tests_smoke_fast_20251004T183142Z.log†L1-L55】
- The latest fast+medium rehearsal (2025-10-06) before plugin consolidation aborts because pytest-bdd is registered twice when nested `pytest_plugins` declarations import the plugin from both `tests/unit/interface/conftest.py` and repository root hooks, producing `ValueError: Plugin already registered...` and leaving the coverage gate red.【F:logs/devsynth_run-tests_fast_medium_20251006T033632Z.log†L1-L84】
- The latest fast+medium aggregate (2025-10-12) achieved 92.40 % coverage with artifacts, knowledge-graph IDs, and per-module deltas recorded in the manifest. EDRR reasoning loop coverage remained at 87.34 %, so we added a fast-only matrix suite to drive the module to 100 % coverage while we prepare the refreshed fast+medium run once collection issues are resolved.【F:test_reports/coverage_manifest_20251012T164512Z.json†L1-L51】【F:tests/unit/methodology/edrr/test_reasoning_loop_branch_completeness.py†L31-L518】【2c757f†L1-L19】
- 2025-10-06 21:22–21:46 UTC reruns show a strict mypy regression isolated to the segmentation helpers in `devsynth.testing.run_tests`; the command now exits non-zero and publishes negative knowledge-graph updates (`QualityGate b2bd60e7-30cd-4b84-8e3d-4dfed0817ee3`, `TestRun 71326ec2-aa95-49dd-a600-f3672d728982`, `ReleaseEvidence {380780ed-dc94-4be5-bd34-2303db9c0352, b41d33ba-ac98-4f2a-9f72-5387529d0f96}`) with logs at `diagnostics/mypy_strict_20251006T212233Z.log` and `diagnostics/typing/mypy_strict_20251127T000000Z.log`. The regression must be resolved before we can regenerate the strict manifests and deliver the release bundle.【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_20251006T212233Z.log†L1-L32】【F:diagnostics/typing/mypy_strict_20251127T000000Z.log†L1-L40】
- A targeted fast-only rerun for `methodology/edrr/reasoning_loop.py` on 2025-10-05 captured 68.89 % coverage (`reasoning_loop_fast.json`) to guide remaining test additions ahead of the aggregate rerun.【F:artifacts/releases/0.1.0a1/fast-medium/20251015T000000Z-fast-medium/reasoning_loop_fast.json†L1-L25】
- Behavior and property suites previously passed with strict marker discipline, but the current smoke failure prevents us from rerunning the verification scripts until the memory Protocol regression is fixed.【F:logs/devsynth_run-tests_smoke_fast_20251004T183142Z.log†L7-L55】
 
### 2025-10-05 Regression Audit (multi-disciplinary)
- **Test hygiene (QA discipline)** – Targeted `pytest` invocations now surface SyntaxErrors in several unit suites because repository-wide speed markers were injected inside import lists. The parser stops at `pytestmark = [pytest.mark.fast]` before the closing parenthesis, preventing collection entirely.【d62a9a†L12-L33】
- **Plugin discipline (tooling/infra)** – pytest 8+ now rejects the duplicate `pytest_bdd` registration created by nested `pytest_plugins` exports; until we consolidate plugin wiring, every aggregate run fails before any tests collect.【F:logs/devsynth_run-tests_fast_medium_20251006T033632Z.log†L1-L84】
- **Behavior evidence (UX/BDD discipline)** – Earlier WebUI behavior suites referenced `general/*.feature` paths that no longer existed, so pytest-bdd attempted to open `tests/behavior/general/webui.feature` and failed before step bindings executed.【6cd789†L12-L28】 Fresh copies now live under `tests/behavior/features/general/` (for example `webui_bridge.feature` and `complete_sprint_edrr_integration.feature`), and the regenerated `verify_requirements_traceability_20251006T233102Z.txt` / `verify_test_markers_20251006T233106Z.txt` manifests confirm the assets resolve even while other collection regressions remain.【F:tests/behavior/features/general/webui_bridge.feature†L1-L9】【F:tests/behavior/features/general/complete_sprint_edrr_integration.feature†L1-L18】【F:diagnostics/verify_requirements_traceability_20251006T233102Z.txt†L1-L1】【F:diagnostics/verify_test_markers_20251006T233106Z.txt†L1-L1】
- **CLI observability (runtime discipline)** – The long-running progress indicator imports `_ProgressIndicatorBase` before the alias is defined, so every CLI progress suite aborts with `NameError`, blocking both smoke and coverage instrumentation rehearsals.【68488c†L1-L27】
- **Integration provenance (operations discipline)** – Deployment automation integration tests declare `pytestmark` without importing pytest, causing `NameError` and erasing slow-lane coverage. Similar patterns appear across other integration suites.【e85f55†L1-L22】
- **Optional service gating (platform discipline)** – The previously documented fixture regressions remain: Chromadb/Faiss/Kuzu discovery still raises hard errors when extras are absent, and pytest-8 rejects `pytest_plugins` declarations in nested modules. These continue to block collection until addressed.【F:issues/test-collection-regressions-20251004.md†L16-L33】

### 2025-10-07 Multi-Disciplinary Update
- **Tooling (plugin discipline)** – With PR-0 merged, duplicate `pytest_bdd` registration is resolved and collection runs can
  focus on the remaining SyntaxError/IndentationError failures.【F:logs/pytest_collect_only_20251007.log†L1-L40】
- **Typing (tooling discipline)** – `poetry run task mypy:strict` continues to fail on the segmentation helpers, so PR-2 remains
  the highest-priority typing fix before we can refresh knowledge-graph evidence.【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_20251006T212233Z.log†L1-L32】
- **Runtime (memory/progress)** – Smoke mode still stops on the `MemoryStore` Protocol TypeError and delayed `_ProgressIndicatorBase`
  aliasing, requiring PR-4 before we can validate coverage instrumentation again.【F:logs/devsynth_run-tests_smoke_fast_20251004T183142Z.log†L7-L55】【68488c†L1-L27】
- **QA/BDD (behavior assets)** – Behavior steps retain indentation drift and dangling `feature_path` sentinels, keeping fast+medium
  rehearsals red until PR-1 and PR-3 realign loaders and assets.【F:diagnostics/testing/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20251006T155925Z.log†L1-L25】【6cd789†L12-L28】
- **Documentation/Release (evidence freshness)** – Coverage and typing manifests remain stale; PR-6 will regenerate them once the
  functional fixes above land.【F:test_reports/coverage_manifest_20251012T164512Z.json†L1-L56】

### 2025-10-06 Evening Update (multi-disciplinary)
- **Behavior scaffolding (QA discipline)** – `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --report --no-parallel` still aborts during collection because multiple behavior step modules contain indentation drift and dangling `feature_path` sentinels; pytest halts before running tests, preventing new coverage evidence.【F:diagnostics/testing/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20251006T155925Z.log†L1-L25】
- **Progress + memory foundations (runtime discipline)** – Smoke mode remains blocked by the `MemoryStore` Protocol TypeError, while `_ProgressIndicatorBase` imports still race; both must be fixed before behavior or CLI regressions can be validated again.【F:logs/devsynth_run-tests_smoke_fast_20251004T183142Z.log†L7-L55】【68488c†L1-L27】
- **Plugin lifecycle (tooling discipline)** – Duplicate `pytest_bdd` registration persists when nested `pytest_plugins` exports load the plugin twice, so every fast+medium rehearsal fails before collection completes.【F:logs/devsynth_run-tests_fast_medium_20251006T033632Z.log†L1-L84】
 - **Verification evidence (quality discipline)** – The 2025-10-06 21:22 UTC rerun regressed the strict mypy gate, so we must repair the segmentation helpers and re-run `poetry run mypy --strict src/devsynth` alongside the fast+medium aggregate and smoke commands to refresh the evidence bundle.【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_20251006T212233Z.log†L1-L32】【F:diagnostics/typing/mypy_strict_20251127T000000Z.log†L1-L40】【F:docs/plan.md†L1-L42】

## Dialectical Evaluation of RFC Scope
- **Thesis (Ambitious Adoption):** Implement the full RFC (knowledge graph expansion, multi-agent rotation, UI, compliance engine) now to align alpha with long-term vision.
- **Antithesis (Pragmatic Release):** Attempting the full RFC now would prolong the alpha indefinitely; strict typing and coverage already block the release.
- **Synthesis (Targeted Execution):** For v0.1.0a1 prioritize infrastructure that directly affects reliability metrics (typing, coverage, tests, traceability) and leave heavyweight platform upgrades for post-alpha follow-up. RFC elements that provide immediate validation, traceability, or gating remain in-scope; exploratory UX and large-scale backends are deferred.

## Socratic Cross-Examination
1. **What is the release-blocking problem?** Maintainer automation still cannot finish because `task release:prep` stops at the duplicate `overrides` error even though go-task now parses cleanly, and smoke mode continues to abort on the `MemoryStore` Protocol TypeError, so gating evidence remains stale.【F:diagnostics/release_prep_20251004T193235Z.log†L1-L20】【F:logs/devsynth_run-tests_smoke_fast_20251004T183142Z.log†L7-L55】
2. **What proofs confirm remediation?** Passing Taskfile commands, a green smoke log, refreshed strict mypy manifests, and a ≥90 % fast+medium manifest that lifts the EDRR coverage delta.【F:test_reports/coverage_manifest_20251012T164512Z.json†L1-L51】
3. **What resources do we control?** Existing diagnostics, the knowledge-graph linked coverage bundle, prior strict typing artifacts, and the in-repo task/issue tracker.
4. **Which initiatives deliver immediate value?** Taskfile repair, memory Protocol fixes, optional backend guardrails, and documentation/UAT updates directly unblock gating; large RFC expansions remain out-of-scope for the alpha window.【F:docs/tasks.md†L334-L347】
5. **What stops execution today?** Pending ownership of the automation + smoke fixes and outdated issues that still imply readiness; the refreshed PR breakdown assigns responsibilities and sequencing to close this gap.【F:docs/release/v0.1.0a1_execution_plan.md†L31-L62】【F:issues/release-readiness-assessment-v0-1-0a1.md†L52-L82】

## High-Impact Objectives (Pre-Tag)
1. **Consolidate pytest plugin wiring (Completed 2025-10-07)** so pytest-bdd loads exactly once by hoisting nested `pytest_plugins` declarations into root configuration. Before the hoist, fast+medium rehearsals failed during collection with `ValueError: Plugin already registered` because pytest imported `pytest_bdd` twice.【F:logs/devsynth_run-tests_fast_medium_20251006T033632Z.log†L1-L84】 After exporting plugins from the repository root, the regression commands `pytest --collect-only -q` and `pytest -k nothing --collect-only` now complete without duplicate registration, confirming stable collection for both full and deselected discovery passes.【F:logs/pytest_collect_only_20251007.log†L1-L40】【F:logs/pytest_collect_only_20251006T043523Z.log†L1-L24】
2. **Unblock collection hygiene quickly** by repairing misplaced `pytestmark` declarations, behavior step indentation, and missing pytest imports so unit/integration suites import cleanly again without triggering SyntaxError/NameError.【d62a9a†L12-L33】【F:diagnostics/testing/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20251006T155925Z.log†L1-L25】【e85f55†L1-L22】
3. **Close the strict typing regression** by repairing segmentation helpers in `devsynth.testing.run_tests`, expanding unit tests, and rerunning `poetry run mypy --strict` to publish fresh knowledge-graph evidence.【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_20251006T212233Z.log†L1-L32】【F:diagnostics/typing/mypy_strict_20251127T000000Z.log†L1-L40】
4. **Realign behavior specifications** by correcting scenario paths, regenerating WebUI/UXBridge feature evidence, and ensuring every `.feature` file resolves during `pytest --collect-only -q`, restoring traceability promised in the improvement plan; the new `tests/behavior/features/general/*.feature` copies and refreshed manifests demonstrate the path alignment is in place even as remaining collection hygiene lands.【F:tests/behavior/features/general/webui_bridge.feature†L1-L9】【F:tests/behavior/features/general/complete_sprint_edrr_integration.feature†L1-L18】【F:diagnostics/verify_requirements_traceability_20251006T233102Z.txt†L1-L1】【F:diagnostics/verify_test_markers_20251006T233106Z.txt†L1-L1】
5. **Recover CLI progress and memory foundations** by moving the `_ProgressIndicatorBase` definition ahead of dependent classes, repairing the `MemoryStore` Protocol generics, and validating both with focused smoke/unit tests under strict typing.【68488c†L1-L27】【F:logs/devsynth_run-tests_smoke_fast_20251004T183142Z.log†L7-L55】
6. **Finish outstanding optional-backend guardrails** so resource-dependent suites skip gracefully while pytest 8+ recognises plugin configuration without runtime errors.【F:issues/test-collection-regressions-20251004.md†L16-L33】
7. **Re-run automation and coverage gates** — `task release:prep`, `poetry run mypy --strict src/devsynth`, and `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --report --no-parallel` — capturing refreshed artifacts and updating UAT documentation once hygiene fixes land.【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_src_devsynth_20251006T155640Z.txt†L1-L1】【F:test_reports/coverage_manifest_20251012T164512Z.json†L1-L56】
8. **Re-evaluate documentation alignment recommendations** from the critical-improvements dossier once the gates are green, prioritising docs/plan.md follow-ups that close implementation/documentation gaps.【F:docs/analysis/critical_recommendations.md†L1-L74】

## 2025-10-06T22:00Z Dialectical & Socratic Update
- **Thesis:** Archived coverage and earlier strict typing artifacts demonstrate readiness, suggesting we could tag without further remediation.【F:test_reports/coverage_manifest_20251012T164512Z.json†L1-L56】
- **Antithesis:** The latest strict mypy run fails on segmentation helpers and smoke still aborts, so evidence is stale and irreproducible.【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_20251006T212233Z.log†L1-L32】【F:diagnostics/typing/mypy_strict_20251127T000000Z.log†L1-L40】【F:logs/devsynth_run-tests_smoke_fast_20251004T183142Z.log†L7-L55】
- **Synthesis:** Deliver a short sequence of targeted PRs—typing fix, hygiene cleanup, memory/progress repair, optional backend guards—then regenerate strict mypy, smoke, and fast+medium artifacts while updating documentation and issues per the critical recommendations. This multi-disciplinary approach (tooling, QA, runtime, documentation) keeps us aligned with the improvement plan and ensures reproducible proofs.【F:docs/analysis/critical_recommendations.md†L1-L74】【F:docs/tasks.md†L330-L347】
- **Socratic checklist:**
  1. *What is broken?* Strict mypy segmentation helpers, smoke execution, behavior collection.【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_20251006T212233Z.log†L1-L32】【F:logs/devsynth_run-tests_smoke_fast_20251004T183142Z.log†L7-L55】【F:diagnostics/testing/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20251006T155925Z.log†L1-L25】
  2. *What proves success?* Zero-error strict mypy log, green smoke transcript, refreshed fast+medium manifest with ≥90 % coverage, and updated issues/docs referencing the new artifacts.【F:test_reports/coverage_manifest_20251012T164512Z.json†L1-L56】【F:docs/tasks.md†L330-L347】
  3. *What disciplines act?* Tooling/infra (typing harness), QA (test hygiene and BDD assets), runtime (memory/progress), documentation (issues + release docs).【F:docs/analysis/critical_recommendations.md†L1-L74】
  4. *What guardrails remain?* Skip TestPyPI, keep workflows dispatch-only, maintain marker discipline, and gate optional services via environment flags until extras install.【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L1-L11】【F:docs/tasks.md†L365-L409】

## Parallelization Notes
- PR-0 must land first to stop pytest from aborting on duplicate plugin registration; subsequent hygiene work depends on a stable plugin manager.
- PR-1 repairs SyntaxErrors and missing imports, unlocking the rest of the suite once plugin wiring is stable.
- After PR-1 merges, the strict typing regression (PR-2) and behavior/runtime fixes (PR-3–PR-5) can proceed in parallel because they touch different subsystems.
- PR-6 consolidates automation and evidence once the earlier fixes land; it should branch only after PR-2 through PR-5 pass their targeted collections and smoke.
- PR-7 remains the integration checkpoint wrapping up UAT and post-tag planning.

## Task Board Snapshot
- `docs/typing/strict_typing_wave1.md` — enumerates targeted modules, owners, error counts, and follow-up experiments for the strict typing wave.【F:docs/typing/strict_typing_wave1.md†L1-L29】
- `docs/testing/coverage_wave1.md` — maps low-coverage modules to planned tests, responsible engineers, and knowledge-graph-linked evidence.【F:docs/testing/coverage_wave1.md†L1-L37】
- Update `docs/tasks.md` §21 with new subtasks referencing PR numbers and diagnostics.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Typing:** `poetry run mypy --strict src/devsynth` returns exit code 0 with updated suppressions documented and archived under `diagnostics/`.
2. **Testing:** `poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast --speed=medium --report --no-parallel` meets ≥90 % coverage with refreshed HTML/JSON artifacts, and smoke mode (`poetry run devsynth run-tests --smoke --speed=fast --no-parallel --maxfail=1`) passes to prove basic functionality.
3. **Behavior Specs:** All new/updated specs link to BDD features, each test includes one speed marker, behavior step indentation is validated via `pytest --collect-only -q`, and property tests run under `DEVSYNTH_PROPERTY_TESTING=true`.
4. **Documentation:** Issues, release docs, and traceability matrices accurately reflect remaining work and completed items, including the post-tag GitHub Actions reactivation sequence.
5. **Dialectical Audit:** `dialectical_audit.log` receives an entry summarizing the synthesis reached in this plan.

## Immediate Next Steps (Action Items)
0. **Regression suite baselines:** Capture the standing collection and smoke previews with `task tests:collect` and `task tests:smoke-dry-run` so the transcripts under `diagnostics/` prove both `poetry run pytest --collect-only -q` and the smoke dry-run command stay green before attempting heavier rehearsals.【F:Taskfile.yml†L38-L43】【F:Taskfile.yml†L104-L109】
1. **PR-0 delivered:** Hoisted plugin registration on 2025-10-07, replacing the earlier duplicate `pytest_bdd` import failure with clean `pytest --collect-only -q` and `pytest -k nothing --collect-only` transcripts that now serve as regression commands for collection stability.【F:logs/devsynth_run-tests_fast_medium_20251006T033632Z.log†L1-L84】【F:logs/pytest_collect_only_20251007.log†L1-L40】【F:logs/pytest_collect_only_20251006T043523Z.log†L1-L24】
2. Follow with **PR-1** to fix misplaced `pytestmark` declarations, behavior step indentation, and missing pytest imports, capturing clean `pytest -k nothing` and behavior collection transcripts as proof of recovery.【d62a9a†L12-L33】【F:diagnostics/testing/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20251006T155925Z.log†L1-L25】【e85f55†L1-L22】
3. Run **PR-2** (strict typing segmentation fix) in parallel with **PR-3** and **PR-4**: repair the segmentation helpers, update behavior scenario paths, hoist `_ProgressIndicatorBase`, and patch the `MemoryStore` Protocol so typing and smoke return green; record refreshed diagnostics and unit/BDD evidence for each stream.【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_20251006T212233Z.log†L1-L32】【6cd789†L12-L28】【68488c†L1-L27】【F:logs/devsynth_run-tests_smoke_fast_20251004T183142Z.log†L7-L55】
4. Execute **PR-5** to finish optional backend guardrails, ensuring resource checks no longer halt collection before coverage can run.【F:issues/test-collection-regressions-20251004.md†L16-L33】
5. After PR-0 through PR-5 merge, pursue **PR-6** and **PR-7** sequentially to regenerate automation artifacts, align documentation with the critical recommendations dossier, and compile the UAT/post-tag bundles for maintainer review.【F:docs/analysis/critical_recommendations.md†L1-L74】【F:issues/release-finalization-uat.md†L49-L60】【F:issues/re-enable-github-actions-triggers-post-v0-1-0a1.md†L1-L18】
