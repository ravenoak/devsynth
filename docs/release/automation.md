# Release Automation

DevSynth uses scripted steps to prepare and tag each release.

## Artifact Generation

Generate distribution and documentation artifacts:

```bash
poetry run task release:prep
```

## Audit

Produce a dialectical audit log and resolve any findings:

```bash
poetry run python scripts/dialectical_audit.py
```

## Tagging

Create an annotated tag after the artifacts and audit complete:

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "DevSynth vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

Before tagging, set the release note's front matter to `status: "draft"`.
After creating the tag, update the status to `published` and rerun the
release-state check:

```bash
poetry run python scripts/verify_release_state.py
```

These steps ensure every release includes generated artifacts, a recorded audit, and a signed tag.
