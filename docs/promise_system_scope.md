# Promise System: Capability Declaration, Authorization, and Management

## 1. Overview

The Promise System is a core architectural component of DevSynth that provides a formalized capability declaration, verification, and authorization framework. It enables agents to declare their capabilities, request capabilities from other agents, and track the fulfillment of promised actions. This system is foundational to DevSynth's agent collaboration model, ensuring accountability, transparency, and proper authorization.

## 2. Key Concepts

### 2.1 Promises

A Promise is a formal declaration of intent to perform a specific capability with particular parameters and constraints. Promises have clearly defined states (pending, fulfilled, rejected, cancelled) and can be organized hierarchically through parent-child relationships. Promises serve as both contracts between system components and as a mechanism for tracking the progress and outcomes of operations.

### 2.2 Promise States

- **Pending**: Promise has been created but not yet fulfilled
- **Fulfilled**: Promise has been successfully completed with a valid result
- **Rejected**: Promise has failed to be fulfilled (with error information)
- **Cancelled**: Promise has been terminated before completion (with reason)


### 2.3 Promise Types

The system defines a taxonomy of capability types that can be promised, including:

- File operations (read, write)
- Code analysis and generation
- Test execution
- LLM querying
- Memory access
- Agent communication
- Orchestration control


### 2.4 Authorization Model

The Promise System implements a strict authorization model where:

- Agents must be authorized to create promises of specific types
- Authorization may be limited by parameters (e.g., file paths, memory scopes)
- Self-authorization is prevented through a third-party authority
- Fulfillment and rejection may require different authorization than creation


## 3. Core Components

### 3.1 Promise Manager

The Promise Manager handles the lifecycle of promises:

- Creation of new promises
- Tracking promise state transitions
- Maintaining parent-child relationships
- Providing query capabilities for promise retrieval
- Recording fulfillment results or rejection reasons


### 3.2 Promise Authority

The Promise Authority enforces access control:

- Verifies agent authorization for capabilities
- Manages capability registrations
- Prevents circumvention of security boundaries
- Mediates capability delegation between agents
- Logs authorization decisions for auditing


### 3.3 Promise Registry

The Promise Registry catalogs available capabilities:

- Maintains a database of registered capabilities
- Tracks which agents can provide which capabilities
- Stores constraints and requirements for capabilities
- Facilitates capability discovery and matching


## 4. Integration with EDRR Methodology

The Promise System integrates directly with DevSynth's "Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect" methodology:

### 4.1 Expand Phase Integration

During the Expand phase, the Promise System:

- Discovers available capabilities from system components
- Registers these capabilities in the Promise Registry
- Builds a capability graph showing relationships and dependencies


### 4.2 Differentiate Phase Integration

During the Differentiate phase, the Promise System:

- Validates capability declarations against actual implementations
- Identifies capability gaps or conflicts
- Verifies authorization rules for consistency


### 4.3 Refine Phase Integration

During the Refine phase, the Promise System:

- Optimizes capability registrations for performance
- Prunes obsolete capabilities
- Strengthens capability relationships
- Updates authorization rules based on system changes


### 4.4 Retrospect Phase Integration

During the Retrospect phase, the Promise System:

- Analyzes promise fulfillment patterns and failures
- Identifies opportunities for capability consolidation or expansion
- Plans capability improvements for the next iteration
- Refines authorization policies based on observed patterns


## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Core Interfaces

The Promise System is defined by two primary interfaces:

#### 5.1.1 IPromiseManager Interface

Provides methods for promise lifecycle management:

- `create_promise`: Create a new promise
- `fulfill_promise`: Mark a promise as fulfilled with a result
- `reject_promise`: Mark a promise as rejected with an error
- `cancel_promise`: Cancel a pending promise
- `get_promise`: Retrieve a specific promise
- `list_promises`: Query promises matching criteria
- `create_child_promise`: Create a sub-promise linked to a parent
- `validate_promise_chain`: Check integrity of promise relationships
- `get_promise_chain`: Retrieve all promises in a hierarchical chain


#### 5.1.2 IPromiseAuthority Interface

Provides methods for authorization management:

- `can_create`: Check if an agent can create a specific promise type
- `can_fulfill`: Check if an agent can fulfill a specific promise
- `can_reject`: Check if an agent can reject a specific promise
- `can_cancel`: Check if an agent can cancel a specific promise
- `can_delegate`: Check if an agent can delegate a promise
- `register_capability`: Register a new capability for an agent
- `list_agent_capabilities`: List all capabilities of an agent


### 5.2 Data Model

#### 5.2.1 Promise

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `type`: Type of capability
- `parameters`: Specific parameters for this promise
- `state`: Current state (pending, fulfilled, rejected, cancelled)
- `metadata`: Associated metadata (creation time, owner, etc.)
- `result`: Result when fulfilled
- `error`: Error message if rejected
- `parent_id`: Parent promise if this is a sub-promise
- `children_ids`: Child promises if this has sub-promises


#### 5.2.2 PromiseMetadata

- `created_at`: Creation timestamp
- `owner_id`: ID of the agent that created the promise
- `context_id`: Context or task ID
- `tags`: User-defined tags
- `trace_id`: For distributed tracing
- `priority`: Importance level


### 5.3 Storage and Persistence

The Promise System uses a layered storage approach:

1. In-memory cache for active promises
2. SQLite database for persistence across sessions
3. JSON serialization for export/import capabilities


This allows for efficient runtime operations while maintaining a historical record of promise activities.

## 6. Using the Promise System

### 6.1 Agent Registration

Agents register their capabilities on initialization:

```python

# Agent registration example

promise_authority.register_capability(
    agent_id="code_agent_001",
    promise_type=PromiseType.CODE_GENERATION,
    constraints={
        "max_file_size": 1_000_000,
        "allowed_languages": ["python", "javascript", "typescript"],
        "forbidden_paths": ["/etc", "/usr"]
    }
)
```

## 6.2 Creating and Fulfilling Promises

Agents create promises for their intended actions:

```python

# Creating a promise

promise = promise_manager.create_promise(
    type=PromiseType.CODE_GENERATION,
    parameters={
        "file_path": "/project/src/module.py",
        "language": "python",
        "description": "Implement data processing function"
    },
    owner_id="code_agent_001",
    context_id="task_123",
    tags=["code", "generation", "data-processing"]
)

# ... perform the promised action ...

# Fulfilling the promise

fulfilled_promise = promise_manager.fulfill_promise(
    promise_id=promise.id,
    result={
        "file_path": "/project/src/module.py",
        "code": "def process_data(input_data):\n    ...",
        "success": True
    }
)
```

## 6.3 Promise Chains for Complex Operations

Complex operations can be modeled as promise chains:

```python

# Creating a parent promise

parent_promise = promise_manager.create_promise(
    type=PromiseType.CODE_ANALYSIS,
    parameters={"project_dir": "/project/src"},
    owner_id="analysis_agent_001",
    context_id="task_456"
)

# Creating child promises for subtasks

for file in files_to_analyze:
    child_promise = promise_manager.create_child_promise(
        parent_id=parent_promise.id,
        type=PromiseType.FILE_READ,
        parameters={"file_path": file},
        owner_id="analysis_agent_001"
    )
```

## 8. Conclusion

The Promise System provides DevSynth with a robust framework for capability declaration, authorization, and fulfillment tracking. By formalizing the ways in which agents declare their intentions and capabilities, the system enhances transparency, security, and accountability. The integration with DevSynth's EDRR methodology ensures that the Promise System evolves alongside the project it's analyzing, adapting to changing structures and requirements.

As DevSynth continues to mature, the Promise System will become increasingly central to its operation, enabling sophisticated multi-agent collaborations while maintaining clear boundaries and authorization controls.
