## Command Reference

DevSynth provides a command-line interface with the following commands:

> **Note**: The commands previously named `analyze` and `adaptive` were renamed
> to `inspect` and `refactor`.

### `init`

Initializes a new DevSynth project.

```bash
devsynth init [--path PATH]
```

**Options:**

- `--path PATH`: Path to initialize the project (default: current directory)


**Example:**

```bash
devsynth init --path ./my-new-project
```

**Details:**
Running `devsynth init` launches a short interactive wizard. The wizard asks for
the project root, preferred source layout (`single_package` or `monorepo`),
primary language, optional project goals and an optional path to a constraint
file. Your answers are written to `.devsynth/project.yaml` by default or to the
`pyproject.toml` file if you choose that option when prompted.

`devsynth init` also scaffolds a `tests/` directory populated with example
unit, integration and behavior tests. These samples help verify the
environment and serve as starting points for your own test suites.

### `inspect`

Inspects requirements from a file or interactively.

```bash
devsynth inspect [--input FILE] [--interactive]
```

**Options:**

- `--input FILE`: Path to requirements file to inspect
- `--interactive`: Start an interactive session for requirement gathering


**Example:**

```bash
devsynth inspect --input requirements.md
```

**Details:**
This command processes requirements and provides insights about their completeness, consistency, and clarity. It helps identify potential issues before proceeding to specification generation.

### `inspect-code`

Inspects a codebase to understand its architecture, structure, and quality.

```bash
devsynth inspect-code [--path PATH]
```

**Options:**

- `--path PATH`: Path to the codebase to inspect (default: current directory)


**Example:**

```bash
devsynth inspect-code --path ./my-project
```

**Details:**
This command analyzes any codebase (not just DevSynth projects) to provide insights about its architecture, structure, code quality, and test coverage. It can detect different architecture types (Hexagonal, MVC, Layered, Microservices) and identify potential issues and improvement opportunities. This is useful for understanding existing projects or evaluating the quality of generated code.

### `inspect`

Generates specifications from requirements.

```bash
devsynth inspect [--requirements-file FILE]
```

**Options:**

- `--requirements-file FILE`: Path to requirements file (default: requirements.md)


**Example:**

```bash
devsynth inspect --requirements-file custom-requirements.md
```

**Details:**
This command creates detailed specifications based on the provided requirements. It expands high-level requirements into more detailed specifications that can be used for test generation.

### `run-pipeline`

Generates tests from specifications.

```bash
devsynth run-pipeline [--spec-file FILE]
```

**Options:**

- `--spec-file FILE`: Path to specifications file (default: specs.md)


**Example:**

```bash
devsynth run-pipeline --spec-file custom-specs.md
```

**Details:**
This command creates test files based on the specifications. It generates unit tests, integration tests, and other test types as appropriate for the project.

### `refactor`

Generates implementation code from tests.

```bash
devsynth refactor
```

**Example:**

```bash
devsynth refactor
```

**Details:**
This command creates implementation code that satisfies the generated tests. It follows a test-driven development approach, ensuring that the code meets the requirements specified in the tests.

### `run-pipeline`

Executes the generated code.

```bash
devsynth run-pipeline [--target TARGET]
```

**Options:**

- `--target TARGET`: Specific target to run (e.g., unit-tests, integration-tests, all)


**Example:**

```bash
devsynth run-pipeline --target unit-tests
```

**Details:**
This command runs the generated code or tests based on the specified target. It provides feedback on test results and code execution.

### `config`

Configures DevSynth settings.

```bash
devsynth config [--key KEY] [--value VALUE]
```

**Options:**

- `--key KEY`: Configuration key to set or view
- `--value VALUE`: Value to set for the configuration key


**Example:**

```bash
devsynth config --key model --value gpt-4
```

**Details:**
This command allows you to view or modify DevSynth configuration settings. It provides a way to customize the behavior of DevSynth for your specific needs.

### `doctor` / `check`

Validates environment configuration files for common issues.

```bash
devsynth doctor [--config-dir DIR]
devsynth check [--config-dir DIR]
```

**Example:**

```bash
devsynth doctor --config-dir ./config
```

**Details:**
Run this command before other workflows to ensure your `config/*.yml` files are complete. If no configuration is found, the output suggests running `devsynth init` to generate defaults.

## Configuration Options

DevSynth can be configured using the `config` command or by editing the configuration file directly. The following configuration options are available:

### LLM Configuration

| Key | Description | Default Value | Possible Values |
|-----|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| `model` | The LLM model to use | `gpt-3.5-turbo` | Any model supported by LM Studio |
| `temperature` | Creativity level (higher = more creative) | `0.7` | 0.0 - 1.0 |
| `max_tokens` | Maximum tokens for responses | `2000` | Any positive integer |
| `endpoint` | LM Studio API endpoint | `http://localhost:1234/v1` | Any valid URL |
| `openai_api_key` | OpenAI API key for using OpenAI models | None | Valid OpenAI API key |
| `serper_api_key` | Serper API key for web search functionality | None | Valid Serper API key |
| `memory_store_type` | Type of memory store to use | `memory` | `memory`, `file`, `Kuzu` |

### Offline Mode

Enable `offline_mode` in your configuration to avoid all remote LLM calls.
When this flag is `true` the CLI selects the OfflineProvider, which returns
deterministic text and embeddings or loads a local model from
`offline_provider.model_path`. See
[Offline Provider details](../technical_reference/llm_integration.md#offline-provider)
for more information.

### Environment Variables and .env Files

DevSynth supports loading configuration from environment variables and `.env` files. This is especially useful for sensitive information like API keys.

#### Using Environment Variables

You can set environment variables directly in your shell:

```bash

# Set OpenAI API key

export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Set Serper API key

export SERPER_API_KEY=your-serper-key

# Set DevSynth-specific configuration

export DEVSYNTH_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4
export DEVSYNTH_LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.8
```

## Using .env Files

Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```text

# API Keys

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
SERPER_API_KEY=your-serper-key

# DevSynth Configuration

DEVSYNTH_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4
DEVSYNTH_LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.8
```

DevSynth will automatically load this file when it starts.

## Environment Variable Naming

DevSynth-specific configuration variables use the `DEVSYNTH_` prefix:

| Environment Variable | Configuration Key |
|----------------------|------------------|
| `DEVSYNTH_MEMORY_STORE` | `memory_store_type` |
| `DEVSYNTH_MEMORY_PATH` | `memory_file_path` |
| `DEVSYNTH_KUZU_DB_PATH` | `kuzu_db_path` |
| `DEVSYNTH_KUZU_EMBEDDED` | `kuzu_embedded` |
| `DEVSYNTH_MAX_CONTEXT_SIZE` | `max_context_size` |
| `DEVSYNTH_CONTEXT_EXPIRATION_DAYS` | `context_expiration_days` |
| `DEVSYNTH_LLM_PROVIDER` | `llm_provider` |
| `DEVSYNTH_LLM_API_BASE` | `llm_api_base` |
| `DEVSYNTH_LLM_MODEL` | `llm_model` |
| `DEVSYNTH_LLM_MAX_TOKENS` | `llm_max_tokens` |
| `DEVSYNTH_LLM_TEMPERATURE` | `llm_temperature` |
| `DEVSYNTH_LLM_AUTO_SELECT_MODEL` | `llm_auto_select_model` |

API keys use their standard environment variable names:

| Environment Variable | Configuration Key |
|----------------------|------------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `openai_api_key` |
| `SERPER_API_KEY` | `serper_api_key` |

### `.devsynth/project.yaml`

| Key | Description | Default Value | Possible Values |
|-----|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| `project_name` | Name of the project | Based on directory name | Any string |
| `project_description` | Description of the project | Empty string | Any string |
| `author` | Author of the project | System username | Any string |
| `license` | License for the project | `MIT` | Any valid license identifier |

### Development Configuration

| Key | Description | Default Value | Possible Values |
|-----|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| `test_framework` | Testing framework to use | `pytest` | `pytest`, `unittest` |
| `code_style` | Code style to follow | `pep8` | `pep8`, `google`, `numpy` |
| `documentation_style` | Documentation style | `google` | `google`, `numpy`, `sphinx` |

### Memory Configuration

DevSynth supports multiple memory store types for storing and retrieving memory items. Available backends include **ChromaDB**, **Kuzu**, **FAISS**, **LMDB**, and in-memory or file-based stores. The embedded ChromaDB backend ships with the retrieval extras and Kuzu remains the recommended persistent option.

#### In-Memory Store

The default memory store type is `memory`, which stores all items in memory. This is fast but not persistent across sessions.

```bash

# Configure in-memory store

devsynth config --key memory_store_type --value memory
```

## File-Based Store

The `file` memory store type uses a JSON file for persistent storage. This ensures that memory items are preserved across sessions.

```bash

# Configure file-based store

devsynth config --key memory_store_type --value file
devsynth config --key memory_file_path --value /path/to/memory/directory
```

## Kuzu Memory Store

The `Kuzu` memory store type uses Kuzu as a lightweight database for persistent storage. If the `Kuzu` Python package is unavailable, the store falls back to an in-memory implementation.

```bash

# Configure Kuzu store

devsynth config --key memory_store_type --value Kuzu
devsynth config --key memory_file_path --value ~/.devsynth/Kuzu
devsynth config --key kuzu_db_path --value ~/.devsynth/Kuzu/Kuzu.db
devsynth config --key kuzu_embedded --value true
```

Key features of the Kuzu memory store:

- **Embedded Database**: Stores memory items in Kuzu for fast local access
- **Vector Support**: Integrates a simple vector adapter for similarity search
- **Fallback Mode**: Automatically falls back to an in-memory store when Kuzu is not available


## UXBridge Configuration

DevSynth uses the UXBridge abstraction to provide a consistent interface across different user interfaces (CLI, WebUI, Agent API). The following configuration options are available for UXBridge:

### UXBridge Settings

| Key | Description | Default Value | Possible Values |
|-----|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| `uxbridge_settings.default_interface` | The default interface to use | `cli` | `cli`, `webui`, `api` |

```bash

# Configure default interface

devsynth config --key uxbridge_settings.default_interface --value webui
```

## WebUI Configuration

The WebUI interface is built using Streamlit and provides a graphical interface for DevSynth. To enable the WebUI interface, you need to enable the `uxbridge_webui` feature flag:

```bash

# Enable WebUI interface

devsynth enable-feature uxbridge_webui
```

## Agent API Configuration

The Agent API interface provides a REST API for DevSynth. To enable the Agent API interface, you need to enable the `uxbridge_agent_api` feature flag:

```bash

# Enable Agent API interface

devsynth enable-feature uxbridge_agent_api
```

## Feature Flags

DevSynth uses feature flags to enable or disable specific features. The following feature flags are available:

| Feature Flag | Description | Default Value |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| `experimental_features` | Enable experimental features | `false` |
| `edrr_framework` | Enable the EDRR framework | `false` |
| `wsde_collaboration` | Enable WSDE collaboration | `false` |
| `uxbridge_webui` | Enable the WebUI interface | `false` |
| `uxbridge_agent_api` | Enable the Agent API interface | `false` |

You can enable or disable feature flags using the `enable-feature` and `disable-feature` commands:

```bash

# Enable a feature

devsynth enable-feature edrr_framework

# Disable a feature

devsynth disable-feature experimental_features
```

Alternatively, you can set feature flags directly in the configuration:

```bash

# Enable a feature

devsynth config --key features.edrr_framework --value true

# Disable a feature

devsynth config --key features.experimental_features --value false
```

## Workflow Guide

DevSynth follows an "expand, differentiate, refine" approach to software development:

### 1. Expand

In this phase, DevSynth takes high-level requirements and expands them into detailed specifications. This involves:

1. Analyzing requirements for completeness and consistency
2. Identifying implicit requirements
3. Expanding requirements into detailed specifications
4. Organizing specifications into a coherent structure


**Commands used in this phase:**

- `inspect`
- `spec`


### 2. Differentiate

In this phase, DevSynth differentiates the specifications into concrete tests and implementation plans. This involves:

1. Creating test cases for each specification
2. Defining test scenarios and edge cases
3. Establishing acceptance criteria
4. Planning the implementation structure


**Commands used in this phase:**

- `test`


### 3. Refine

In this phase, DevSynth refines the implementation based on the tests. This involves:

1. Generating implementation code
2. Running tests to verify the implementation
3. Refining the code to address any issues
4. Ensuring the code meets all requirements


**Commands used in this phase:**

- `code`
- `run`


## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Requirements

1. **Be specific**: Clearly state what the system should do
2. **Use consistent terminology**: Maintain consistent terms throughout requirements
3. **Focus on functionality**: Describe what the system should do, not how it should do it
4. **Include constraints**: Specify any limitations or constraints
5. **Prioritize requirements**: Indicate which requirements are essential


Example of a good requirement:

```text
The system shall allow users to reset their password via email within 5 minutes of the request.
```

### Managing Projects

1. **Organize by feature**: Group related requirements by feature
2. **Version control**: Use version control for requirements and generated artifacts
3. **Iterative development**: Start with core requirements and expand incrementally
4. **Review generated artifacts**: Always review specifications, tests, and code
5. **Maintain traceability**: Ensure you can trace code back to requirements


### Optimizing LLM Usage

1. **Start with clear requirements**: Well-defined requirements lead to better results
2. **Adjust temperature**: Lower for precise tasks, higher for creative tasks
3. **Review and refine**: Iteratively improve generated artifacts
4. **Use appropriate context**: Provide relevant context for better results
5. **Balance token usage**: Be mindful of token limits


## Advanced Usage

### Custom Templates

DevSynth supports custom templates for specifications, tests, and code. You can create templates in the `tests/templates` directory:

- `tests/templates/spec_template.md`: Template for specifications
- `tests/templates/unit_test_template.py`: Template for test files
- `tests/templates/code_template.py`: Template for code files


### Integration with Version Control

DevSynth works well with version control systems like Git:

```bash

# Initialize Git repository

git init

# Add DevSynth files

git add requirements.md specs.md tests/ src/

# Commit changes

git commit -m "Initial DevSynth project"
```

## Custom Workflows

You can create custom workflows by combining DevSynth commands:

```bash

# Example custom workflow script

#!/bin/bash
devsynth inspect --input requirements.md
devsynth inspect
devsynth run-pipeline
devsynth refactor
devsynth run-pipeline --target unit-tests
```

## Extending DevSynth

DevSynth follows a hexagonal architecture that makes it extensible. You can extend it by:

1. Creating custom adapters for different LLM providers
2. Implementing custom agents for specialized tasks
3. Adding new commands for additional functionality
4. Creating plugins for integration with other tools


For more information on extending DevSynth, refer to the [Architecture Documentation](architecture_documentation.md) and [API Reference](api_reference.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection errors with LM Studio**:
   - Ensure LM Studio is running
   - Verify the endpoint configuration
   - Check network connectivity

2. **Out of memory errors**:
   - Reduce the model size
   - Optimize token usage
   - Increase system memory

3. **Poor quality output**:
   - Improve input requirements
   - Adjust temperature settings
   - Review and refine generated artifacts


## Current Limitations

Collaborative WSDE workflows, dialectical reasoning, and full EDRR automation are
still experimental. These features are off by default in `config/default.yml` and
may produce incomplete results. Automated code, test, and documentation generation
often requires manual review. See the
[Feature Status Matrix](../implementation/feature_status_matrix.md) for specifics.
