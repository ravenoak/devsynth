# DevSynth CLI Usage

This short reference outlines the most common DevSynth commands. Recent releases renamed some commands for clarity:

- `init` – initialize a project directory
- `inspect` – analyze requirements interactively or from a file
- `run-pipeline` – execute generated code or tests
- `refactor` – suggest the next workflow steps

Use `devsynth --help` for the full list of available commands and options.
