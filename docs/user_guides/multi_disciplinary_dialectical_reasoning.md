# Multi-disciplinary Dialectical Reasoning

Multi-disciplinary dialectical reasoning gathers perspectives from diverse disciplines to synthesize well-rounded solutions. Use it when problems benefit from inputs across fields.

1. Configure a reasoner with agents representing distinct disciplines.
2. Pose a complex problem to the reasoner.
3. Review the synthesized evaluation that cites each discipline.
