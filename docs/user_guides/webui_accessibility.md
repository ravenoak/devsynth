# Planned WebUI: UX Standards and Accessibility Checklist

Status: Forward-looking guidance to inform the future WebUI. Aligns with project guidelines principles (clarity, safety, determinism) and emphasizes inclusive, accessible design.

## UX Standards
- Clear, actionable messaging
  - Use concise headlines and supportive descriptions.
  - Mirror CLI messaging principles (docs/user_guides/cli_command_reference.md) for consistency.
- Progressive disclosure
  - Default to safe, minimal choices; reveal advanced options on demand.
- Deterministic interactions
  - Disable actions while requests are in-flight; show spinners with plain-language status.
- Error handling
  - Provide remediation hints; avoid leaking low-level exceptions. Map errors to an opinionated taxonomy.
- Keyboard-first mindset
  - All interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard.
- Dark/light theme parity
  - Maintain contrast and clarity in both modes.

## Accessibility Checklist (WCAG-inspired)
- Semantics and landmarks
  - Use proper HTML roles and landmarks: header, main, navigation, complementary, contentinfo.
  - Form controls have associated labels; use aria-* only when native semantics are insufficient.
- Color and contrast
  - Meet contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 for text; ≥ 3:1 for large text and UI components.
  - Do not rely on color alone to convey state.
- Focus management
  - Visible focus indicators; logical tab order; trap focus only in modal dialogs.
  - Return focus to the invoking element on dialog close.
- Keyboard operability
  - All actions (including complex widgets) operable via keyboard; provide shortcuts where appropriate.
  - Avoid key collisions with screen reader shortcuts.
- Motion and flashing
  - Respect prefers-reduced-motion; avoid animations that flash more than 3 times per second.
- Live regions and updates
  - Announce async updates via aria-live where content changes without navigation.
- Forms and validation
  - Inline error messages tied to inputs via aria-describedby; provide clear remediation.
- Media and alternatives
  - Provide text alternatives for non-text content; captions/transcripts for audio/video.
- Internationalization
  - Support basic i18n plumbing (lang attributes, RTL consideration) in layout.

## Implementation Notes (when WebUI lands)
- Adopt component library with strong a11y posture (e.g., Radix primitives) or enforce design review checklists.
- Add axe-core automated checks in CI for UI packages.
- Provide an accessibility statement and feedback channel.

## Traceability
- Tasks: 25.1 in docs/tasks.md.
- Plan: docs/plan.md (determinism and clarity principles).
