# Atomic Rewrite Tutorial

The atomic rewrite utility restructures a repository's commit history so that
each commit touches a single file. This can make code review and traceability
clearer.

## Usage

```bash
devsynth mvu rewrite --path PATH_TO_REPO --branch-name atomic
```

Use `--dry-run` to preview the operation without creating commits.

The rewritten history is placed on the branch specified by `--branch-name`.
