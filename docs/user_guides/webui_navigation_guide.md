# DevSynth WebUI Navigation Guide

## Introduction

The DevSynth Web User Interface (WebUI) is built with NiceGUI and provides a user-friendly way to interact with DevSynth's powerful features through your web browser. This guide will help you navigate the WebUI and understand the functionality available on each page.

![DevSynth WebUI Overview](../images/webui/webui_overview.png)

## Getting Started

To launch the DevSynth WebUI, use the following command:

```bash
devsynth webui
```

This will start the NiceGUI-based WebUI and open it in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can access it at http://localhost:8080.
