# MVUU Overview

Minimum Viable Utility Units (MVUU) capture the smallest useful change that advances the project. The MVUU engine records these units for traceability and reporting.

Refer to [docs/specifications/mvuuschema.json](../specifications/mvuuschema.json) for the full schema.

## Workflow Summary

1. Create a specification such as `mvuu_spec.json` following the schema.
2. Commit code and documentation with references to the MVUU record.
3. Generate reports using the MVUU tooling to track progress.
