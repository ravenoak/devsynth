# Dear PyGui User Guide

The Dear PyGui interface provides a lightweight desktop client for DevSynth. It shares workflow logic with the CLI through the [UXBridge abstraction](../architecture/uxbridge.md), allowing commands to be reused across interfaces.

## Installation

Install the GUI extra and run the interface module:

```bash
poetry install --extras gui
poetry run python -m devsynth.interface.dpg_ui
```

## Using the GUI

Launching the module opens a window that mirrors the DevSynth CLI. Every
available command is exposed as a button. Clicking a button runs the same
workflow as the CLI while displaying a modal progress dialog. Commands that
require additional input present wizard-style forms that guide you through the
necessary steps.

Longâ€‘running operations update the progress bar automatically so you can track
completion without blocking the interface. Errors are reported in modal
dialogs, allowing you to retry or inspect the output.

## Command Mapping

The table below shows how common CLI commands map to Dear PyGui actions.

| CLI Command | Dear PyGui Action |
|-------------|------------------|
| `init`      | **Init** button |
| `inspect`   | **Inspect** button |
| `gather`    | **Gather** button |

For a full mapping of commands across interfaces, see the [CLI to WebUI and Dear PyGUI Command Mapping](../architecture/cli_webui_mapping.md).

## MVUU Dashboard

Launch the MVUU traceability dashboard to explore commit links:

```bash
devsynth mvuu-dashboard
```

The dashboard uses Streamlit to visualize traceability information.

Enable the dashboard and desktop client by setting feature flags in your configuration:

```yaml
features:
  gui: true
  mvuu_dashboard: true
```

## Dialogs and Feature Flags

### Requirements Wizard

Use the **Wizard** button to launch a step-by-step dialog for capturing project requirements. Each step collects information and shows a progress indicator so you can track completion.

### Progress Dialog

Long-running commands display a modal progress window that can be cancelled if needed. This dialog is reused across operations to provide feedback without blocking the interface.

### Enabling Features

The wizard and progress dialogs are guarded by the `experimental` feature flag. Enable it with:

```bash
devsynth enable-feature experimental
```

or add the flag directly in your configuration:

```yaml
features:
  experimental: true
```

Refer to the [Configuration Reference](configuration_reference.md#feature-flags) for details on managing feature flags. These dialogs were introduced in the [0.1.0-alpha.1 milestone](../roadmap/release_plan.md#010-alpha1) and will evolve as the release plan progresses.
