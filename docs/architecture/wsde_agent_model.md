# WSDE Agent Model: Worker Self-Directed Enterprise

## Overview

The Worker Self-Directed Enterprise (WSDE) model is a collaborative multi-agent framework used in DevSynth that enables autonomous agents to work together in a democratic, self-organizing manner. Inspired by real-world worker cooperatives, the WSDE model distributes authority and responsibility among specialized agents, each contributing their expertise while collectively making decisions.

## Core Principles

1. **Distributed Authority**: No single agent has complete control; decision-making is collaborative.
2. **Specialization with Collaboration**: Agents have specialized roles but work together on complex tasks.
3. **Dialectical Reasoning**: Agents engage in thesis-antithesis-synthesis reasoning to reach optimal solutions.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: The team regularly evaluates and improves its processes and outcomes.
5. **Transparency**: All decisions and their rationales are documented and accessible.

## Agent Roles

The WSDE team consists of specialized agents with distinct roles and responsibilities:

### Architect Agent

- Documenting design decisions and their rationales
- Creating user guides and API documentation

**Integration Points**:
- Works with all other agents to document their work
- Ensures documentation reflects the current state of the system
- Provides documentation feedback to improve code clarity

### Coordinator Agent

**Responsibilities**:
- Facilitating communication between agents
- Managing the workflow and task assignments
- Resolving conflicts between agents
- Ensuring the team follows the EDRR process

**Integration Points**:
- Interfaces with all agents to coordinate activities
- Manages the EDRR process flow
- Ensures all agents have the information they need

## Collaboration Patterns

### Democratic Decision-Making

The WSDE team makes decisions through a democratic process:

1. **Proposal**: Any agent can propose a solution or approach
2. **Discussion**: All agents discuss the proposal, offering perspectives from their domains
3. **Dialectical Analysis**: The team applies thesis-antithesis-synthesis reasoning
4. **Consensus Building**: The team works toward consensus, not just majority rule
5. **Decision**: The team makes a collective decision
6. **Documentation**: The decision and its rationale are documented

### Task Allocation

Tasks are allocated based on:

1. **Specialization**: Tasks are assigned to agents with relevant expertise
2. **Workload Balance**: Tasks are distributed to maintain balanced workloads
3. **Dependencies**: Task dependencies are considered in allocation
4. **Agent Input**: Agents have input on task assignments
5. **Collective Oversight**: The team collectively monitors progress

### Conflict Resolution

When conflicts arise, the team follows this process:

1. **Identification**: Clearly identify the conflict and its root causes
2. **Perspective Sharing**: Each agent shares their perspective
3. **Dialectical Analysis**: Apply thesis-antithesis-synthesis reasoning
4. **Solution Generation**: Generate potential solutions
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate solutions against project goals
6. **Consensus Building**: Work toward a consensus solution
7. **Documentation**: Document the conflict and its resolution

## Integration with EDRR Framework

The WSDE model integrates seamlessly with the EDRR (Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect) framework:

### Expand Phase
- **Architect Agent**: Proposes architectural approaches
- **Developer Agent**: Suggests implementation strategies
- **Tester Agent**: Identifies testing approaches
- **Requirements Agent**: Clarifies requirements and constraints
- **Documentation Agent**: Gathers relevant documentation
- **Coordinator Agent**: Facilitates brainstorming sessions

### Differentiate Phase
- **Architect Agent**: Evaluates architectural trade-offs
- **Developer Agent**: Assesses implementation complexity
- **Tester Agent**: Evaluates testability of approaches
- **Requirements Agent**: Verifies alignment with requirements
- **Documentation Agent**: Documents comparison of approaches
- **Coordinator Agent**: Facilitates evaluation discussions

### Refine Phase
- **Architect Agent**: Finalizes architecture design
- **Developer Agent**: Implements the selected approach
- **Tester Agent**: Develops comprehensive tests
- **Requirements Agent**: Tracks requirement implementation
- **Documentation Agent**: Creates implementation documentation
- **Coordinator Agent**: Coordinates implementation activities

### Retrospect Phase
- **Architect Agent**: Evaluates architectural decisions
- **Developer Agent**: Reviews code quality and performance
- **Tester Agent**: Analyzes test coverage and effectiveness
- **Requirements Agent**: Verifies all requirements were met
- **Documentation Agent**: Ensures documentation is complete
- **Coordinator Agent**: Facilitates retrospective discussions

## Implementation Details

### Agent Communication

Agents communicate through:

1. **Shared Memory**: A central memory system accessible to all agents
2. **Structured Messages**: Standardized message format for inter-agent communication
3. **Collaborative Workspace**: Shared workspace for collaborative tasks
4. **Meeting Protocols**: Structured protocols for team discussions

### Agent State Management

Each agent maintains:

1. **Role-Specific Knowledge**: Specialized knowledge related to their role
2. **Task Context**: Current task context and status
3. **Team Awareness**: Awareness of other agents' activities
4. **Historical Memory**: Record of past decisions and activities

### Example: Collaborative Code Review

```
COLLABORATIVE CODE REVIEW PROCESS:

1. Developer Agent submits code for review
   - Provides implementation details
   - Highlights design decisions
   - Notes any concerns or questions

2. Architect Agent reviews architectural aspects
   - Evaluates alignment with architecture
   - Identifies potential architectural improvements
   - Provides architectural feedback

3. Tester Agent reviews testability
   - Evaluates test coverage
   - Identifies potential edge cases
   - Suggests additional tests

4. Requirements Agent verifies requirement implementation
   - Confirms all requirements are met
   - Identifies any requirement gaps
   - Verifies requirement traceability

5. Documentation Agent reviews documentation
   - Checks documentation completeness
   - Ensures code comments are clear
   - Suggests documentation improvements

6. Coordinator Agent facilitates discussion
   - Identifies areas of agreement and disagreement
   - Ensures all perspectives are considered
   - Helps build consensus on improvements

7. Team collectively approves or requests changes
   - Provides consolidated feedback
   - Prioritizes requested changes
   - Documents review decisions
```

## Best Practices for WSDE Implementation

1. **Balance Specialization and Collaboration**: Ensure agents are specialized but not siloed
2. **Encourage Dialectical Thinking**: Promote thesis-antithesis-synthesis reasoning
3. **Document Decision Rationale**: Always document why decisions were made
4. **Regular Retrospectives**: Conduct regular team retrospectives
5. **Continuous Learning**: Incorporate feedback to improve team performance
6. **Transparent Communication**: Ensure all agents have access to necessary information
7. **Respect Expertise**: Value each agent's domain expertise
8. **Collective Ownership**: Foster a sense of collective ownership of outcomes

## Using WSDETeam

The `WSDETeam` class in `domain.models.wsde` manages collaborative agents. To
use it:

```python
from devsynth.domain.models.wsde import WSDETeam

team = WSDETeam()
team.add_agents([agent_a, agent_b])

# Dynamically assign roles for a new task
task = {"type": "documentation", "description": "Write API docs"}
team.dynamic_role_reassignment(task)

# Agents contribute solutions
team.add_solution(task, {"agent": agent_a.name, "content": "Initial draft"})
team.add_solution(task, {"agent": agent_b.name, "content": "Formatting updates"})

# Build consensus on the final approach
final = team.build_consensus(task)
print(final["consensus"])
```

## Current Limitations

Full WSDE collaboration is still under development. The latest release adds
dynamic role reassignment and fully functional consensus voting. Collaboration
remains disabled by default via the `features.wsde_collaboration` flag in
`config/default.yml`.
Refer to the
[Feature Status Matrix](../implementation/feature_status_matrix.md) for the
latest progress details.
