# WebUI Architecture Overview

The WebUI presents DevSynth workflows via Streamlit while reusing the
existing CLI logic through the `UXBridge` abstraction. The `WebUI`
class implements the bridge methods and exposes navigable pages for the
core workflows.

## Pseudocode

```python
class WebUI(UXBridge):
    def run(self):
        st.set_page_config(page_title="DevSynth WebUI", layout="wide")
        page = st.sidebar.radio(
            "Navigation",
            ("Onboarding", "Requirements", "Analysis", "Synthesis", "Config"),
        )
        if page == "Onboarding":
            self.onboarding_page()
        elif page == "Requirements":
            self.requirements_page()
        # additional pages omitted
```

## High-Level Flow

```mermaid

    Start --> Sidebar
    Sidebar -->|select| Router
    Router --> Onboarding
    Router --> Requirements
    Router --> Analysis
    Router --> Synthesis
    Router --> Config
    Router -->|bridged| CLI
```

The sidebar acts as a router. Each page delegates workflow execution to
the same CLI commands used in the terminal interface, ensuring feature
parity while benefiting from Streamlit components such as collapsible
sections and progress indicators.
