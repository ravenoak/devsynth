## Overview

The Architecture section provides a comprehensive view of DevSynth's design and structure. It explains how the different components of the system work together to achieve the project's goals.

DevSynth follows a hexagonal architecture (also known as ports and adapters) that separates the core domain logic from external adapters and application services. This architecture enables flexibility, testability, and maintainability by ensuring that the core business logic is isolated from external concerns.

The system is composed of several key components:

- **Agent System**: A collection of specialized agents that work together to perform various tasks in the development process.
- **Memory System**: A sophisticated system for storing and retrieving information, enabling agents to maintain context and learn from past interactions.
- **Provider System**: A flexible integration layer that allows DevSynth to work with different LLM providers and external services.

DevSynth also employs several methodologies and frameworks:

- **Dialectical Reasoning**: A structured approach to problem-solving that involves thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.
- **EDRR Framework**: A methodology for expanding, differentiating, refining, and retrospecting on ideas and solutions.
- **WSDE Agent Model**: A model for agent behavior that combines wide exploration with deep analysis.

## Getting Started

If you're new to DevSynth's architecture, we recommend starting with the [Overview](overview.md), which provides a high-level understanding of the system. Then, explore the [Hexagonal Architecture](hexagonal_architecture.md) document to understand the fundamental design pattern used throughout the project.
