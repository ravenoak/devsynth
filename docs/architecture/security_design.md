# Security Design

This document outlines high-level security considerations for DevSynth. It complements the [Security Policy](../policies/security.md) and will expand as the security framework matures.

Current focus areas include:

- Secure handling of API keys and credentials
- Role-based access control for CLI operations
- Input sanitization utilities to prevent injection attacks


Detailed threat models and mitigation strategies are forthcoming.
