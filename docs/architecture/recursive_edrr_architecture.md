# Recursive EDRR Architecture

This document describes how the Expand-Differentiate-Refine-Retrospect (EDRR) framework operates recursively within DevSynth. It explains the flow of nested cycles and points to the underlying algorithms.

## Overview

The EDRR framework can spawn micro-cycles within each major phase. These micro-cycles execute the same four phases, allowing complex tasks to be broken down into smaller problems. Recursion continues until termination heuristics indicate no further benefit.

See the [Recursive EDRR Pseudocode](../specifications/recursive_edrr_pseudocode.md) for function signatures and recursion flow. Termination heuristics are covered in [Delimiting Recursion Algorithms](../specifications/delimiting_recursion_algorithms.md).

## Benefits

- **Scalable Problem Solving**: Complex tasks are decomposed into manageable subtasks.
- **Continuous Learning**: Each cycle captures lessons that inform higher-level cycles.
- **Adaptive Depth**: Recursion depth adjusts based on context and heuristics.
