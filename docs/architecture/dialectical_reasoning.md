# Dialectical Reasoning System for Requirements Management

## Overview

The Dialectical Reasoning System is a component of DevSynth that enables intelligent evaluation of proposed changes to requirements. It uses dialectical reasoning—a method of examining ideas by juxtaposing opposing arguments (thesis and antithesis) to arrive at a resolution (synthesis)—to assess the impact and validity of requirement changes.

## Key Features

- **Dialectical Evaluation**: Analyzes requirement changes by generating thesis, antithesis, arguments, synthesis, and recommendations
- **Impact Assessment**: Identifies affected requirements and components, assesses risk levels, and estimates effort
- **Chat Interface**: Provides an interactive dialogue system for discussing requirement changes
- **Notification System**: Alerts stakeholders about proposed changes, approvals, rejections, and impact assessments

## Architecture

The Dialectical Reasoning System follows the hexagonal architecture pattern of DevSynth:

### Domain Layer

- **Models**: 
  - `Requirement`: Represents a system requirement
  - `RequirementChange`: Represents a proposed change to a requirement
  - `DialecticalReasoning`: Represents the dialectical reasoning process and results
  - `ImpactAssessment`: Represents the impact assessment of a change
  - `ChatSession` and `ChatMessage`: Represent chat interactions with the reasoning system

### Ports Layer

- **Inbound Ports**:
  - `DialecticalReasonerPort`: Interface for the dialectical reasoning service
  - `ChatPort`: Interface for the chat interaction service

- **Outbound Ports**:
  - `RequirementRepositoryPort`: Interface for requirement storage
  - `ChangeRepositoryPort`: Interface for change storage
  - `DialecticalReasoningRepositoryPort`: Interface for reasoning storage
  - `ImpactAssessmentRepositoryPort`: Interface for impact assessment storage
  - `ChatRepositoryPort`: Interface for chat storage
  - `NotificationPort`: Interface for notification services

### Application Layer

- **Services**:
  - `DialecticalReasonerService`: Implements the dialectical reasoning process
  - `RequirementService`: Manages requirements and changes

### Adapters Layer

- **Inbound Adapters**:
  - `CLIChatAdapter`: CLI interface for chat interactions
  - CLI commands for requirements management

- **Outbound Adapters**:
  - `InMemoryRequirementRepository`: In-memory storage for requirements
  - `InMemoryChangeRepository`: In-memory storage for changes
  - `InMemoryDialecticalReasoningRepository`: In-memory storage for reasoning
  - `InMemoryImpactAssessmentRepository`: In-memory storage for impact assessments
  - `InMemoryChatRepository`: In-memory storage for chat sessions and messages
  - `ConsoleNotificationAdapter`: Console-based notification service

## Dialectical Reasoning Process

1. **Thesis Generation**: Creates a statement arguing in favor of the proposed change
2. **Antithesis Generation**: Creates a statement arguing against the proposed change
3. **Argument Generation**: Generates multiple arguments supporting both the thesis and antithesis
4. **Synthesis Generation**: Creates a balanced view that reconciles the thesis and antithesis
5. **Conclusion and Recommendation**: Provides a final assessment and recommendation on the change

## Impact Assessment Process

1. **Affected Requirements Identification**: Identifies requirements directly or indirectly affected by the change
2. **Affected Components Identification**: Identifies system components affected by the change
3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates the risk level of implementing the change
4. **Effort Estimation**: Estimates the effort required to implement the change
5. **Analysis and Recommendations**: Provides a detailed analysis and actionable recommendations

## Usage

### CLI Commands

The Dialectical Reasoning System can be accessed through the following CLI commands:

```bash
# List all requirements
devsynth requirements --action list

# Show a specific requirement
devsynth requirements --action show --id <requirement-id>

# Create a new requirement
devsynth requirements --action create --title "Requirement Title" --description "Requirement Description"

# Update a requirement
devsynth requirements --action update --id <requirement-id> --title "New Title" --reason "Update reason"

# Delete a requirement
devsynth requirements --action delete --id <requirement-id> --reason "Deletion reason"

# List changes for a requirement
devsynth requirements --action changes --id <requirement-id>

# Approve a change
devsynth requirements --action approve-change --id <change-id>

# Reject a change
devsynth requirements --action reject-change --id <change-id> --comment "Rejection reason"

# Start a chat session about a change
devsynth requirements --action chat --id <change-id>

# List chat sessions
devsynth requirements --action sessions

# Continue a chat session
devsynth requirements --action continue-chat --id <session-id>

# Evaluate a change using dialectical reasoning
devsynth requirements --action evaluate-change --id <change-id>

# Assess the impact of a change
devsynth requirements --action assess-impact --id <change-id>
```

### Interactive Chat

The chat interface allows users to discuss requirement changes with the dialectical reasoning agent:

1. Start a chat session: `devsynth requirements --action chat --id <change-id>`
2. Enter messages to discuss the change
3. The agent will respond with insights, explanations, and recommendations
4. Type 'exit' to end the session

## Extension Points

The Dialectical Reasoning System can be extended in several ways:

1. **Custom Repositories**: Implement the repository interfaces to use different storage mechanisms
2. **Custom Notification Services**: Implement the notification interface to use different notification channels
3. **Enhanced Reasoning Logic**: Extend the dialectical reasoning service to use more sophisticated reasoning algorithms
4. **Web Interface**: Add a web-based chat interface for more user-friendly interactions

## Integration with DevSynth

The Dialectical Reasoning System integrates with the broader DevSynth system:

- It uses the LLM service for generating reasoning content
- It follows the same hexagonal architecture pattern as the rest of DevSynth
- It can be used as part of the requirements analysis phase of the development process

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the Dialectical Reasoning System include:

1. **Multi-Agent Reasoning**: Use multiple specialized agents for different aspects of reasoning
2. **Learning from Decisions**: Improve reasoning over time by learning from past decisions
3. **Visual Representation**: Add visualization of reasoning processes and impact assessments
4. **Integration with External Tools**: Connect with requirements management tools like JIRA or Azure DevOps
5. **Natural Language Processing**: Enhance the ability to understand and process natural language requirements
