# EDRR Framework: Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect

## Overview

The EDRR (Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect) framework is a core methodology used in DevSynth for structured problem-solving and implementation. This dialectical approach ensures comprehensive exploration of solutions, critical evaluation of alternatives, focused implementation, and reflective learning.

```

**Implementation Status**

- The `EDRRCoordinator` fully orchestrates all phases with manifest parser integration.
- Integration with `MemoryManager` and `WSDETeam` is complete, while `AstTransformer`
  and advanced documentation features remain in progress.

## Recursive EDRR Architecture

The EDRR framework is implemented as a recursive, fractal structure where each macro-level phase (Expand, Differentiate, Refine, Retrospect) can contain its own nested micro-EDRR cycles. This recursive approach enables self-optimization at multiple levels of granularity, creating a more adaptive and intelligent development process.

### Key Features of Recursive EDRR

- **Micro-Cycles**: Each phase can spawn micro-EDRR cycles for complex sub-tasks
- **Recursion Depth Control**: Limits prevent excessive nesting of cycles
- **Granularity Thresholds**: Prevents recursion for overly simple tasks
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Ensures recursion provides value relative to effort
- **Quality Monitoring**: Tracks quality metrics to determine when recursion is beneficial
- **Resource Management**: Prevents excessive resource consumption
- **Human Oversight**: Allows human judgment to override automatic recursion decisions

### Example of Recursive EDRR

When implementing a complex feature, the main EDRR might handle the overall process, while micro-cycles address specific challenges:

1. **Main Cycle - Expand Phase**: Exploring approaches for implementing the feature
   - **Micro-Cycle**: Conducting detailed research on a specific technology
     - Has its own Expand, Differentiate, Refine, and Retrospect phases
     - Results feed back into the parent Expand phase

2. **Main Cycle - Differentiate Phase**: Evaluating approaches
   - **Micro-Cycle**: Performing detailed performance testing of alternatives
     - Results feed back into the parent Differentiate phase

3. **Main Cycle - Refine Phase**: Implementing the selected approach
   - **Micro-Cycle**: Developing a complex component of the implementation
     - Results feed back into the parent Refine phase

4. **Main Cycle - Retrospect Phase**: Evaluating the implementation
   - **Micro-Cycle**: Analyzing specific aspects of the implementation
     - Results feed back into the parent Retrospect phase

## Framework Phases

### 1. Expand Phase

The Expand phase focuses on divergent thinking and comprehensive exploration of the problem space.

#### Key Activities

- Brainstorming multiple approaches to solving the problem

#### Example

When tasked with implementing a new feature like "vector memory storage":

```text
EXPAND PHASE OUTPUT:

```

### 2. Differentiate Phase

The Differentiate phase focuses on critical evaluation and comparison of the approaches identified in the Expand phase.

#### Key Activities

## EDRR Coordinator

The EDRR Coordinator orchestrates the flow between components according to the EDRR pattern. It manages the transitions between phases, ensures proper data flow, and maintains the state of the EDRR.

### Key Responsibilities

- Initializing and managing the EDRR
- Coordinating component interactions in each phase
- Managing phase transitions
- Storing and retrieving phase-specific data
- Generating comprehensive reports
- Creating and managing recursive micro-cycles
- Tracking parent-child relationships between cycles
- Enforcing recursion depth limits and quality thresholds

### Recursive Coordination

The coordinator supports recursive EDRR cycles by:
- Creating child coordinators for micro-cycles
- Maintaining parent-child relationships between cycles
- Tracking recursion depth to prevent excessive nesting
- Applying granularity thresholds to determine when recursion is appropriate
- Performing cost-benefit analysis for potential micro-cycles
- Monitoring quality metrics to guide recursion decisions
- Managing resource allocation across nested cycles
- Supporting human judgment overrides for recursion decisions
- Integrating results from micro-cycles back into parent cycles

### Integration with Other Components

- **Memory System**: Stores and retrieves phase-specific data
- **WSDE Team**: Coordinates agent activities in each phase
- **AST Analyzer**: Directs code analysis and transformation activities
- **Prompt Manager**: Retrieves phase-specific prompt templates
- **Documentation Manager**: Retrieves relevant documentation for each phase

## EDRR Manifest

The EDRR Manifest is a configuration file that defines the structure and parameters of an EDRR. It allows for customization of the EDRR process for specific tasks.

### Manifest Structure

```yaml

description: "EDRR for implementing a new feature"
version: "1.0.0"

  expand:
    instructions: "Explore multiple approaches to implementing the feature"

      - "expand_feature_implementation"
    dependencies: []
    outputs:
      - "approach_list"
      - "challenge_list"

```

## Best Practices for Using EDRR

### General Best Practices

1. **Complete Each Phase**: Don't skip phases, as each contributes to the quality of the final solution.
2. **Document Decisions**: Record the rationale for decisions, especially in the Differentiate phase.
3. **Embrace Dialectical Thinking**: Consider opposing viewpoints and synthesize them into a coherent solution.
4. **Use Phase-Specific Templates**: Leverage the Prompt Manager's phase-specific templates.
5. **Learn from Retrospection**: Use the Retrospect phase to continuously improve the process.
6. **Customize for Task Complexity**: Adjust the depth of each phase based on task complexity.
7. **Leverage Component Integration**: Make full use of the integration between EDRR and other components.

### Recursive EDRR Best Practices

1. **Apply Recursion Strategically**: Use micro-cycles for complex subtasks that benefit from the full EDRR approach.
2. **Maintain Appropriate Granularity**: Don't create micro-cycles for simple tasks that don't warrant the overhead.
3. **Monitor Recursion Depth**: Keep recursion to a reasonable depth (typically 2-3 levels) to avoid complexity explosion.
4. **Balance Cost and Benefit**: Ensure the value gained from recursion justifies the additional time and resources.
5. **Integrate Results Effectively**: Ensure insights and artifacts from micro-cycles are properly integrated into parent cycles.
6. **Use Human Judgment**: Override automatic recursion decisions when human expertise suggests a different approach.
7. **Document Recursive Structure**: Maintain clear documentation of the recursive structure for better understanding and maintenance.

## Implementation Status

The recursive EDRR framework is now fully implemented. Phase transitions are
handled automatically with configurable timeouts and recursion limits. The
coordinator integrates deeply with memory, WSDE agents, and documentation
management to produce a comprehensive final report after each cycle. Feature
flags can still disable collaborative reasoning features, but the core EDRR
orchestration operates end-to-end.
