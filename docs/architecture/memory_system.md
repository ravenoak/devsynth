# DevSynth Memory System Architecture

## Overview

The DevSynth memory system is designed for extensibility, resilience, and semantic search. It supports multiple backends (ChromaDB, SQLite, JSON) via a unified interface, enabling advanced retrieval-augmented workflows and agentic collaboration.

### Key Features
- **ChromaDB Integration**: Vector database for semantic search and scalable storage
- **Provider System Integration**: Uses unified provider system (OpenAI, LM Studio) for embeddings with automatic fallback
- **SQLite Backend**: Structured data storage with efficient indexing
- **Unified Memory Interface**: Abstracts backend details for seamless migration and extension
- **Versioning & Caching**: (Planned) Artifact versioning and in-memory caching for performance

## MemoryPort (Hexagonal Adapter)
- Exposes `store_memory`, `retrieve_memory`, `search_memory` methods
- Uses `ChromaDBMemoryStore` by default, but can be configured for other backends
- Ensures all artifacts are stored with metadata, type, and version (future)

## ChromaDBMemoryStore
- Implements the `MemoryStore` protocol
- Stores artifacts as vectors for semantic search
- Leverages provider system for embeddings with automatic fallback mechanisms
- Configurable to use specific providers (OpenAI, LM Studio) or default embedder
- Supports add, retrieve, search, and delete operations
- All test artifacts are isolated and cleaned up via test fixtures

## Provider System Integration
- Uses unified provider abstraction for generating embeddings
- Provides automatic fallback between providers if one is unavailable
- Graceful degradation to default embedder if all providers fail
- Configurable via environment variables and initialization parameters

## Extensibility
- New backends can be added by implementing the `MemoryStore` protocol
- New embedding providers can be added through the provider system
- Migration utilities are planned for seamless data transfer between stores

## Testing & Cleanliness
- All tests use temporary directories and patch environment variables for isolation
- CI checks ensure no workspace pollution
- Test fixtures provide access to LLM providers and embedding capabilities

## Traceability
- Requirements, code, and tests are linked via IDs and doc references
- See `docs/specifications/current/devsynth_specification.md` and `tests/behavior/test_chromadb_integration.py`

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Enhancements
- Add versioning and caching layers
- Integrate with self-analysis and dialectic reasoning modules
- Expand semantic search to all project artifacts
- Introduce more sophisticated embedding models and techniques

### Multi-Layered Memory System (In Development)
Based on the DevSynth Architecture Course Correction Plan, the memory system will be enhanced with a multi-layered approach:

- **Short-term (working) memory**: For immediate context and current operations
- **Episodic memory**: For past events and operations
- **Semantic memory**: For general knowledge and project understanding

### Additional Storage Backends (Planned)
The memory system will be extended to support additional backends:

- **RDF-based Knowledge Graph**: Using RDFLib for structured semantic memory, supporting documentation indexing, ontology modeling, and contextual agent reasoning
- **TinyDB-backed Store**: For lightweight structured persistence of episodic/working memory
- **Alternative Vector Stores**:
  - **DuckDB with vector extension**: Local, single-file storage with ACID guarantees and SQL query capabilities
  - **FAISS / HNSW libraries**: High-performance nearest-neighbor search for large vector datasets
  - **LMDB (Lightning MDB)**: Extremely fast, memory-mapped key-value store for high read throughput

### Unified Query Interface (Planned)
A Memory Manager layer will provide a unified interface for querying different memory types:

- **GraphMemoryAdapter**: For SPARQL or triple-pattern queries against the knowledge graph
- **VectorMemoryAdapter**: For embedding similarity queries against vector stores
- **TinyDBMemoryAdapter**: For structured queries against episodic/working memory

This unified approach will simplify agent interactions with memory while providing specialized capabilities for different memory types.
