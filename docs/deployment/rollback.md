# Rollback Procedures

This guide describes how to revert the DevSynth stack to a previous release.

## Quick Rollback

Use the helper script to stop the current stack, pull the specified image tag,
restart services, and verify their health:

```bash
scripts/deployment/rollback.sh <previous_tag> [environment]
```

If you prefer to perform the steps manually, follow the process below.

## Manual Steps

1. Stop the current stack:

   ```bash
   scripts/deployment/stop_stack.sh
   ```

2. Pull the previous image tag:

   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/OWNER/REPO:previous-tag
   ```

3. Start the stack with the earlier image:

   ```bash
   scripts/deployment/start_stack.sh
   ```

4. Verify service health:

   ```bash
   deployment/health_check.sh
   ```

## Tests

After performing a rollback, validate the environment:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/unit/deployment
deployment/health_check.sh
```

These checks confirm that the core services and deployment scripts operate as expected.
