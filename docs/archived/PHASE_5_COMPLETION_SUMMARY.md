# Phase 5 Completion Summary
This document is archived for historical reference. It marks the final
phase of the **DevSynth Repository Harmonization Plan** and should not be
confused with the separate "Phase 5" in the Post-MVP roadmap.

Phase 5 centered on **Verification and Validation**. Major outcomes:

- Executed the full test suite to verify functionality and fixed import issues.
- Added missing exception classes and adapter stubs to support testing.
- Standardized the package structure and corrected import paths across tests.
- Finalized the provider subsystem with Anthropic and offline backends.
- Reviewed all documentation for accuracy and ensured bidirectional traceability between requirements, code, and tests.
- Produced this phase summary to capture lessons learned and recommendations for ongoing maintenance.
