Thanks for the clarification—I'll synthesize and refine the system architecture to:

* Integrate Promise Theory deeply across agent reasoning, task planning, execution, and coordination
* Represent context as high-dimensional, layered structures (including task, memory, runtime, environment), allowing agents to model contextual interplay and evolution
* Enhance runtime adaptability through architectural composability—enabling agents to recompose themselves, switch roles, or delegate based on context shifts
* Identify and close remaining gaps in current design patterns (e.g., context propagation, cross-agent promises, asynchronous workflows, internal state cohesion)
* Propose a restructured, modular, yet comprehensive specification designed for both human and LLM consumption, readable and actionable

I'll return shortly with a refined, implementation-ready blueprint.


# Modular CLI-Based SDLC Agent System (Refined Specification)

This document presents a refined **modular CLI-based Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) agent system** architecture. It integrates **Promise Theory**, a **layered context model**, and **runtime adaptability** into a unified design. The goal is to maximize modularity, minimalism, and an intuitive developer experience. The specification clearly separates high-level concepts from concrete implementation choices, and includes examples for clarity. All agents in the system should be able to reason dialectically (weighing different perspectives) and learn from cross-context interplay, leading to more robust performance over time.

## 1. Promise Theory Integration in Agents

Every agent and major component in the system must declare explicit **promises** about its behavior. These promises serve as contracts defining what the agent **can do**, under what **conditions**, and what it **will not do**, improving transparency and coordination.

* **Agent Capability Promises:** Each agent publishes the tasks or services it can perform (e.g. *“can generate Python code given a spec”* or *“can run unit tests on code modules”*), along with any conditions or contexts required. By making intentions public in this way, agents enable voluntary cooperation rather than central enforcement. An agent may promise, for example, *“I will produce a solution within 60 seconds if the task is a bug-fix and I have access to the codebase”*. These capability promises let other agents or the orchestrator know which agent is suitable for a given sub-task.

* **Context and Constraint Promises:** Agents also declare what contexts or resources they require (e.g. *“needs internet access to fetch dependencies”*) and constraints on their behavior (*“will not modify production database”*). Each promise implies a self-imposed constraint on the agent’s behavior. Importantly, an agent only makes promises about its **own** behavior – it cannot promise something on behalf of another agent. This autonomy is a pragmatic engineering principle to ensure each agent’s role is clearly defined and failure modes are easier to predict.

* **Internal Promises for Reasoning:** Internally, agents utilize promises to guide their reasoning and planning. For example, an agent may have an internal rule like *“if I promise to always verify outputs, I will not finalize a result without running validations.”* These self-promises act as guardrails for the agent’s decision-making process, making its reasoning more introspectable and consistent.

* **Cross-Agent Coordination via Promises:** The system includes a **Promise Broker** component (see Architecture below) that maintains a registry of all active promises made by agents and tools. When an agent is considering delegating a task or calling a tool, it consults this promise registry to find a component that has declared the needed capability. This explicit promise matching makes delegation decisions transparent and traceable. For instance, if a “Planning Agent” needs code generation done, it finds an agent that promised the capability *“generate code”* under current conditions, rather than relying on hard-coded assignments.

* **Dynamic Promises (Derivation & Revocation):** Agents can **derive new promises, modify, or revoke existing promises at runtime** in response to changing context. This aligns with Promise Theory’s view that promises are voluntary and can be withdrawn if needed. For example:

  * An agent might *derive* a new promise after learning a new skill or when a new tool becomes available (e.g. after loading a database module, an agent promises *“can perform SQL queries”*).
  * Agents may *modify* promises based on performance feedback, say relaxing a guarantee (*“response time < 2s”* might be adjusted if the environment is slow).
  * If conditions change (loss of network, revocation of credentials, etc.), an agent can *revoke* a promise it can no longer keep. E.g. if an “API Agent” promised to fetch live data but internet access drops, it withdraws that promise, prompting the system to find alternate strategies.

All promises should be declarative and queryable. This ensures each agent’s capabilities and limits are *transparent*, making the overall system behavior more predictable and easier to inspect or debug. It also fosters trust between agents by clearly documenting expectations (each agent knows what others have committed to do or not do).

**Example – Agent Promise Manifest:**  Below is a sample of how an agent might declare its promises in a structured format (for illustration):

```text
Agent "CodeGen":
  - Promises:
      * Capability: "Generate code in Python or JavaScript"
      * Conditions: "When provided a spec and coding standards context"
      * Will Not: "Modify filesystem or external state without permission"
      * Quality: "Will pass all provided unit tests"
```

In this example, the **CodeGen** agent makes promises about its capabilities and constraints. The system would record these promises so that, if a planning component needs code written, it knows CodeGen can be called. If CodeGen fails to keep a promise (e.g., code does not pass tests), it may revoke or update its quality promise, and the orchestrator may involve a reviewer agent or a different strategy.

## 2. Context-Aware Layered Cognitive Model

The system moves beyond a flat context or simple prompt history. Instead, it employs a **high-dimensional, multi-layered context** model. Different types of context (task goals, memory, environment state, social relationships among agents) are represented as distinct but interconnected layers that collectively influence agent reasoning. A dedicated **Context Engine** manages these contexts, enabling agents to query and reason about context and its provenance.

* **Types of Context Layers:** We define several core context layers:

  * **Task Context:** The immediate objectives, requirements, and plans relevant to the current task or sub-task. This includes the problem statement, user input or instructions, and any decomposed sub-goals. The task context is dynamic – it evolves as the agent makes progress or as new tasks are delegated. It provides *purpose* and *focus* for the agent’s reasoning.
  * **Memory Context:** Background knowledge and history relevant to the task. This can include long-term memory (past interactions, domain knowledge) and short-term memory (recent conversation or steps taken). The memory context is retrieved from the system’s memory stores (e.g. ChromaDB vector embeddings or SQLite records) based on relevance to the task context. For example, if the task is to fix a bug, the memory context may include similar past bug fixes or relevant documentation. This context ensures the agent has access to facts needed to avoid repetition or mistakes.
  * **Runtime Environment Context:** The state of the execution environment and any operational constraints. This includes available tools or APIs, system resources (CPU, memory usage, etc.), time or performance constraints, configuration settings, and external conditions like network connectivity. The runtime context influences what an agent *can* do at a given moment. For instance, if the runtime context indicates “no internet,” the agent knows not to attempt online queries, altering its planning (perhaps using local data instead).
  * **Social / Agent Relationship Context:** Information about the relationships and roles among agents (and possibly the user). In a multi-agent system, this context captures which agents are currently active, their roles (e.g. “Planner”, “Coder”, “Tester”), their trust levels or expertise areas, and any ongoing dialogues between them. It also includes any hierarchy or delegation structure (e.g. an agent assigned as lead coordinator). The social context helps agents reason about **who** should handle a sub-task or how to communicate. For example, an agent might consult this context to find *“who promised to handle deployment?”* or to recall that *“Agent B reviewed the last code; maybe ask Agent B to review again.”*

* **Composability and Interdependence:** These context layers are **composable** objects – they can be combined and influence each other explicitly. Rather than keeping context siloed, the Context Engine allows one context to *affect* another in well-defined ways:

  * The **Task context** can alter what is retrieved in Memory context. For instance, the task context might contain keywords or a problem description that is used to query the vector database for relevant documents or past solutions, thereby populating the memory context with only relevant entries.
  * The **Runtime context** can reshape the task planning. If the runtime layer signals a constraint (like a looming deadline or limited resources), the agent may narrow the scope of the plan or choose a simpler approach. For example, a task context of “run full test suite” might be adjusted if the runtime context says “only 5 minutes left”; the agent could decide to run a smaller subset of critical tests.
  * The **Social context** can influence both task and memory contexts. Knowing which agent is available or has which expertise might change how an agent formulates its task (delegating certain parts) or what information it considers relevant. For instance, if an agent knows another agent specializes in performance optimization, it might consult that agent (task delegation) or recall specific performance-related guidelines (memory) when the task context is about improving speed.
  * Conversely, changes in task progress (task context updates) feed back into social context and runtime. If an agent finishes a sub-task, the social context is updated to mark that agent as free for new tasks, and the runtime context might log resource usage or time taken.

* **Context Engine and Influence Chains:** A **Context Engine** manages these layers. It provides a unified interface for agents to **query** the active context and to **update** context layers as things change. The engine also tracks *influence chains* – essentially, metadata about how one piece of context was influenced by another. For example, if a particular memory snippet was fetched because of a specific task keyword, the engine can record that linkage. Agents can introspect these chains to understand *why* certain information is being considered. This introspection makes the agent’s decision process more explainable: an agent could explain *“I prioritized this step because the runtime context indicated low memory, which in turn caused me to retrieve a smaller dataset in memory context.”*

* **High-Dimensional Representation:** Internally, each context layer can have a rich representation (e.g., vectors, symbols, or JSON structures). The layered context is **high-dimensional** in that it isn’t a single sequence of text, but a structured set of data points. The Context Engine might maintain, for instance, vector embeddings for memory items, a graph of agent relationships for social context, and a set of key-value pairs for runtime settings. By treating context as a multi-dimensional entity, the agent’s prompt or input to the language model can be constructed from multiple parts: a description of the task, relevant knowledge snippets, etc., each coming from the respective context layer. This is similar in spirit to approaches that feed an LLM multiple layers of info (e.g., user data + document context + general knowledge), but here it is formalized into distinct context types.

* **Explicit Context Interplay:** The design explicitly allows and encourages contexts to affect each other **dialectically** – meaning the agent can reason about tensions or trade-offs between contexts. For example, if the task context demands a comprehensive solution but the runtime context imposes strict time limits, the agent should recognize this conflict and reason through a balanced approach (perhaps produce a partial solution and explain the limitation). Agents might even simulate an internal *dialogue* between contexts: *“Task context wants thorough testing, but Runtime says we’re low on time. How do I reconcile this?”* This cross-context reasoning is a form of internal dialectic that leads to more nuanced decisions. The Context Engine can assist by highlighting such context intersections (e.g., flags when a requirement in task context conflicts with a runtime constraint).

**Example – Context Interaction:** Consider a scenario where the user asks the agent system to implement a new feature in code. The **Task context** includes the feature requirements. The **Memory context** is populated with relevant past feature implementations and coding guidelines. The **Runtime context** notes that an internet API required for this feature is currently unreachable (network down). The **Social context** shows that a particular “ResearchAgent” is skilled at finding workarounds. In this case:

* The Planning Agent, seeing the network issue in runtime context, adjusts the Task plan to include *“find offline data or simulate API responses”*.
* It queries Memory context for any cached documentation of the API (since live fetch is unavailable).
* Recognizing its own limitation, it consults the Social context and **delegates** the sub-task of finding an API workaround to the ResearchAgent (because that agent promised *“can find alternative solutions when resources are limited”* in its profile).
* The Context Engine logs how the runtime constraint influenced the plan and delegation (influence chain), so later the system can explain or learn from this event.

## 3. Runtime Adaptability and Architectural Composability

The agent system is designed for **adaptability at runtime**, meaning agents can modify their behavior and even their internal structure on-the-fly in response to feedback or context changes. Agent behaviors are broken into **composable modules** with clear contracts (aligned with their promises and context dependencies). The architecture supports agent **cloning, versioning, and role mutation** as first-class capabilities. These features ensure the system remains flexible and resilient as tasks evolve or unexpected situations arise.

* **Modular Agent Design:** Each agent is composed of interchangeable modules that handle different aspects of its function. For example, an agent might have separate modules for *planning*, *execution*, *error handling*, and *communication*. These modules interact via well-defined interfaces. Because each module’s contract is clear (often defined in terms of promises and context inputs/outputs), an agent can swap out a module without affecting others. For instance, a “CodeAgent” could switch its code generation module from using a large OpenAI model to using a smaller local model if needed, as long as both modules adhere to the same interface of “given design spec, return code”. This plug-and-play modularity fosters easy upgrades and experimentation – developers can add a new strategy module and the agent can choose it at runtime if appropriate.

* **Dynamic Strategy Switching:** Agents continuously monitor their performance and context. If an approach isn’t working, they can **escalate to a fallback strategy** or alter their pipeline. Concretely, an agent may maintain multiple strategies for a task (like a primary plan and a backup). Suppose an agent’s primary plan (Strategy A) fails to produce a result due to a constraint (e.g., running out of time or hitting an error). The agent can detect this (perhaps via exceptions or feedback from a validation module) and *escalate* to Strategy B – a simpler or more brute-force approach that has a lower chance of failure, or perhaps one that uses a different tool. This might also involve delegation: if the agent cannot solve it alone with Strategy B, it might enlist help (e.g., ask a peer agent or call a specialized tool). These fallback behaviors are part of the agent’s design and can be updated as the system learns which strategies work best in which conditions.

* **Self-Modification and Module Swapping:** In some cases, an agent can modify its own structure. For example, if an agent recognizes that a particular type of problem keeps causing it to fail, it could **load a new module** or adjust its internal workflow to better handle that case. This could be facilitated by the system providing a library of optional modules. An agent might say, *“I keep timing out on large data processing. I will load an optimized data handler module for this session.”* Because our architecture defines modules with contracts and uses dependency injection principles, such swaps are feasible at runtime. The system should log these changes (for transparency and debugging), and possibly revert them if they don’t help.

* **Agent Cloning and Scaling:** The architecture supports **cloning agents** as a way to scale out or explore multiple solutions in parallel. Cloning means spawning a new agent instance with the same base configuration (promises, modules) but perhaps a different context or sub-task. For example, if a task can be parallelized (like testing multiple components), the system can clone the “Tester” agent into multiple instances, each handling a subset of tests concurrently. Cloning can also be used for exploration: if an agent is unsure between two approaches, it might clone itself, have each clone try a different approach, and then compare results. The clones inherit the original agent’s promises (possibly with slight variations in context) and register themselves with the promise broker (e.g., *“Tester\_clone\_1 promises to test module A; Tester\_clone\_2 promises to test module B”*). Cloning is a primitive operation in the system, meaning it can be invoked via a simple call, and the Context Engine will duplicate and specialize the context for the new agent as needed.

* **Versioning and Evolution:** Each agent type can have **versions**. A version might correspond to a different prompt template for an LLM, a different algorithm, or a different set of sub-modules. The system could run multiple versions of an agent in parallel (for A/B testing performance), or keep an older version as a fallback if a new version fails. Versioning also helps in tracking improvements – if version 2 of an agent is supposed to be better at a task than version 1, the orchestrator might prefer v2 but automatically switch to v1 if v2 encounters an issue. All versions still adhere to the same promise interfaces for compatibility. The specification should include a way to label agent versions and perhaps a simple mechanism to update or roll back versions.

* **Role Mutation:** Agents are not strictly bound to a single role forever; they can **mutate their role** based on context or explicit direction. Role mutation means an agent can change its operational persona or responsibilities. For instance, an agent that was playing the role of a “Coder” might switch to the role of a “Reviewer” after finishing coding – essentially changing its goal from generation to critique. This could be implemented by loading a different prompt profile or module set corresponding to the new role. Another example: if a “Planner” agent finds that the task actually requires creative writing (outside its normal domain), it might temporarily assume the persona of a “Writer” agent (if it has that capability or by borrowing another agent’s modules). Role mutation is closely governed by promises and context; an agent should only mutate to roles for which it either already has the capabilities or can acquire them (possibly by importing another agent’s promise set or modules). The social context is updated when roles change, so other agents are aware of the new assignment or capabilities of that agent. This fluidity allows the system to cover gaps dynamically – rather than failing because *“that’s not my job,”* an agent can adapt to fulfill the need, within safe limits.

* **Feedback-Driven Learning:** Agents improve their adaptability by leveraging feedback loops. Using frameworks like **DSPy**, the system provides feedback on agent outputs and decisions, allowing iterative refinement. For example, after each action or output, a feedback module can assert whether the outcome met certain criteria. If not, suggestions are provided to the agent on how to adjust its next attempt. An agent might learn that one of its fallback strategies consistently produces better results under certain contexts, and thus start preferring it or even making it the primary. Over time, this feedback-driven self-improvement means the agent’s runtime adaptability is not just reactive but *learning*: the agent updates its internal decision logic (or prompts) to avoid past pitfalls. Cross-context learning is also encouraged – e.g., an agent might notice that *“whenever memory context is sparse, my first attempt fails,”* and thus incorporate a check or a more conservative approach if it detects low relevant memory.

**Example – Adaptability in Action:** Suppose a “BuildAgent” is responsible for compiling and testing software. It usually uses an online CI service (external tool) to run tests (this is its primary strategy). One day, the CI service is down (runtime context update). The BuildAgent has a fallback: run tests locally. It dynamically swaps in a local test-runner module. It also clones itself to run tests on two subsets of test cases in parallel (to save time). During execution, one clone encounters a failing test. The agent’s feedback module uses an assertion to detect an error, triggers a role mutation where the failing clone switches role to “DebuggerAgent” to analyze the failure while the other clone continues testing. The DebuggerAgent (formerly the test-runner clone) uses memory context (past similar bugs) and finds a likely cause. It fixes the issue or reports it. The system thus adapted: switched strategies (online to offline), swapped modules (CI to local runner), cloned agents (parallel testing), and even changed role (tester to debugger) – all guided by context and feedback, without human intervention.

## 4. Unified and Refactored System Architecture

The architecture harmonizes the above concepts with the previously chosen components (LangGraph orchestration, dual-model LLM support, DSPy feedback, hybrid memory stores, CLI interface, etc.). This unified design ensures **state propagation**, **promise management**, and **context introspection** are handled coherently across the system. Figure 1 outlines the high-level architecture (described in text below):

**Figure 1: High-Level Architecture Overview** – The system comprises a CLI interface, an Orchestrator, a set of Agents (with modular internals), a Memory subsystem, dual LLM model support, and specialized layers for Promise management and Context management. These components interact as follows:

* The user (or an automated script) invokes the CLI, specifying a high-level goal or command.
* The Orchestrator (using LangGraph) interprets the request and constructs a directed graph of sub-tasks or agent calls.
* Agents are instantiated or activated as nodes in this graph to perform specific tasks, communicating via the context and promise layers.
* The Memory subsystem (ChromaDB and SQLite) is used by agents to store/retrieve information relevant to tasks.
* LLM interactions may go through either OpenAI API or a local LM Studio model, abstracted behind a model interface.
* Throughout execution, the Promise Broker and Context Engine ensure agents adhere to promises and have up-to-date context, respectively.
* A feedback loop (DSPy and possibly human-in-the-loop via CLI) monitors outputs and guides refinements.

Below, we detail each major component and layer, integrating previous design decisions and highlighting refinements:

### 4.1 CLI Interface and Configuration Layer (Typer + Pydantic)

The system exposes a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** for developers to interact with the multi-agent system. This is built with **Typer**, which provides an intuitive way to define commands and options using Python function annotations. The CLI accepts commands such as `plan`, `execute`, `review`, etc., corresponding to high-level SDLC actions. For example, a user might run:

```
sdlc_agent plan --feature "User login" --target_agent "ArchitectAgent"
```

This would invoke the orchestrator to plan a feature implementation using the Architect agent.

* **Typer for CLI:** Typer was chosen due to its developer-friendly syntax and ability to scale from simple to complex CLI trees easily. Each CLI command maps to a function that internally calls the orchestrator with appropriate parameters.
* **Pydantic for Data Validation:** While Typer handles parsing, **Pydantic** is used to define structured **data models** for inputs and outputs. Pydantic leverages Python type hints to validate and serialize data. For instance, a `FeatureSpec` Pydantic model might define the schema for a feature description passed into the planning agent (ensuring required fields like title, acceptance criteria, etc., are present). This structured approach means agents receive well-defined input objects rather than loose dictionaries, reducing errors. Moreover, agent outputs (like a `Plan` or `CodeDiff`) can also be defined as Pydantic models, ensuring the results conform to expected formats (and making it easier for other agents or tools to consume them).
* **Configuration and Settings:** The CLI also allows loading configuration files (possibly in TOML or YAML) that define agent settings, environment toggles, or model selection. For example, a config might specify to use the local LLM by default, or set thresholds for certain decisions. Pydantic’s settings management can load these configurations and validate them, so the system starts with a known-good configuration.

The CLI layer thus provides an **accessible entry point** for developers and an **integration point** for other systems (CI/CD pipelines, etc.), while ensuring that all input/output data structures are explicit and validated.

### 4.2 Orchestration Layer (LangGraph-based Workflow)

At the core of the system is an **Orchestrator** that decomposes tasks and manages the flow of control among agents. We leverage **LangGraph**, a stateful orchestration framework that represents workflows as graphs of steps or sub-agents. LangGraph enables us to define complex multi-agent interactions (including loops, conditionals, and parallel branches) in a flexible way.

* **Task Graph Construction:** When a CLI command or a high-level goal is received, the Orchestrator constructs a task graph. Nodes in this graph could be agent invocations or tool calls, and edges define the sequence or dependency (e.g., outputs of one node feed into inputs of another). For instance, a `plan` command might create a graph: **\[Requirement Parser] -> \[PlannerAgent] -> \[ReviewerAgent]** (the planner’s output goes to a reviewer).
* **State Persistence:** LangGraph provides a persistence layer for long-running workflows. This means the state of each node (including intermediate agent outputs, decisions made, context changes) is checkpointed. If the process is interrupted or needs human validation at some point, it can be resumed without loss of information. This persistence is useful in SDLC tasks that can be lengthy (like running tests or waiting for external events).
* **Human-in-the-Loop & Interruption:** The orchestration can include manual approval steps or error checks. For example, after generating code, the workflow might pause for a human developer to review, or use a DSPy feedback module to automatically verify correctness. LangGraph’s design makes it straightforward to incorporate these pauses and branches. Agents can also issue *promises* to await certain events (e.g., *“I promise to continue once issue #123 is resolved by a human”*), and the orchestrator will hold that node until the promise is fulfilled or withdrawn (this essentially implements a waiting mechanism using the promise system).
* **Parallelism and Concurrency:** Because the SDLC often has tasks that can run in parallel (multiple tests, coding different modules simultaneously, etc.), the task graph can branch into parallel nodes. LangGraph handles the concurrent execution and synchronization when those branches join. For example, after planning, two coding agents might work in parallel on different components. The orchestrator will wait (or get a promise) from both that they are done before moving to an integration test step.
* **Error Handling:** The orchestrator, informed by promise theory, is prepared for promises to be broken or exceptions to occur. If an agent fails or revokes a promise (say an agent cannot complete a subtask), the orchestrator checks the global promise registry to see if another agent can fulfill the task, or it may invoke a fallback workflow path. This could mean re-routing to a backup agent or triggering an alternative sequence of nodes (for example, if automated testing fails, run a debugging subgraph workflow).
* **Transparency and Introspection:** The orchestration graph, combined with the context engine and promise broker, allows introspection tools (or developers) to visualize what the system is doing. We can output a trace of the workflow graph annotated with which agent handled each node, what promises were involved, and how context changed along the way. This is invaluable for debugging and for the agents themselves (since an agent could query *“where am I in the workflow?”* via the orchestrator interface).

### 4.3 Promise Broker Layer

To implement the **Promise Theory integration**, we introduce a **Promise Broker** component. This can be thought of as a registry and middleware that all agents interface with regarding promises.

* **Promise Registration:** When the system starts or when a new agent is spawned, it **registers its promises** with the Promise Broker. The broker stores each promise along with metadata: which agent made it, scope (internal vs to others), conditions, and any time-to-live (if promises are temporary). Tools or workflows can also register promises. For example, a database tool might promise *“provides persistent storage; data <= 1MB; will not accept writes above threshold X.”* These become part of the overall promise landscape.
* **Lookup and Matching:** Agents (or the orchestrator on their behalf) query the Promise Broker to find providers for certain capabilities. If an agent needs to delegate a subtask, it can ask the broker *“who has promised to do X?”*. The broker can return a list of agents/tools that match, possibly ranking by additional criteria (trust level, availability in social context, etc.). This lookup replaces hard-coded references; the system becomes more **declarative**. For instance, if a new specialized agent is added in the future, as long as it registers its promises, existing agents can discover it without code changes.
* **Promise Enforcement and Mediation:** While the system cannot “force” an agent to keep a promise (promises are voluntary), the broker does track whether promises are upheld or broken. If an agent fails to deliver on a promise, the broker marks that promise (and possibly adjusts a trust score for that agent in the social context). Repeated failures might lead the broker to *advise* the orchestrator to use a different agent next time or require backup even if the agent promises it can do something. The broker essentially acts as a mediator of trust: since promises are the basis of cooperation, this component keeps a memory of how reliable each promise has been historically.
* **Dynamic Promise Updates:** Agents inform the Promise Broker at runtime if they are changing their promises. This could be via an API like `PromiseBroker.update(agent_id, new_promise)` or similar. The broker then notifies relevant parts of the system. For example, if Agent A revokes a promise to handle a certain type of task, and Agent B was waiting (with a dependency on that promise), the broker can signal the orchestrator to find an alternative for B. In the context engine, if promises relate to available tools or services (part of runtime context), the context is updated too (e.g., *“service X no longer available”*).
* **Promise Broker and Context Engine Integration:** The promise broker works closely with the context engine. The **social context** layer in particular is informed by promises – e.g., agent roles and capabilities are basically the promises they advertised. The context engine might query the broker to answer questions like “what capabilities are present in the system right now?” to influence planning. Similarly, when context changes (like environment context signals a new tool is now online), the broker might request agents to consider deriving new promises (if a tool is available, an agent might promise to utilize it).

### 4.4 Context Engine and State Propagation Layer

The **Context Engine** is the subsystem responsible for tracking all context layers (Task, Memory, Runtime, Social) as described in Section 2. It ensures that **state is propagated** appropriately to all components that need it and provides interfaces for context introspection.

* **Unified Context Store:** Internally, the context engine might maintain a composite data structure (or several synchronized ones) representing the current state of each context layer. This could include a blackboard or pub-sub system where context updates are posted. For example, when an agent finishes a sub-task, it updates the Task context (task progress, results) and possibly the social context (marking itself idle or changing role). The context engine receives these updates and immediately propagates them: other agents subscribed to those context changes will get notified or can pull the latest context when they next act.
* **Retrieval Interface:** For memory context, the context engine uses the **Memory subsystem** (see 4.5 below) to fetch relevant information. An agent might call `context_engine.get_memory(topic=XYZ, limit=5)` and the engine will query ChromaDB for the top 5 vectors related to topic XYZ (with Task context as query basis). Similarly, for social context, an agent can query *“who is currently handling task P?”* or *“what is my role?”*. The engine abstracts away the raw data stores and provides semantic queries.
* **Influence Tracking:** The context engine records *why* certain context data was included (influence chains). For example, if a particular documentation snippet is brought into memory context because it matched a keyword in the task, the engine tags it with that rationale. This provenance data can be later used for explanation or for the agent to double-check relevance.
* **Introspection API:** Agents (or developers via CLI) can call introspection methods. For instance, an agent could ask the context engine *“show me all active context elements right now”*. The engine might return a structured snapshot: current task description, list of memory items in use, key runtime constraints, and active agent roster in social context. This helps an agent adjust its reasoning – for example, seeing a runtime constraint explicitly might remind the agent to consider it. The introspection API also allows analysis of context influence: *“what caused this memory item to be selected?”* could yield *“because it was referenced in requirement 4 of the task spec”*.
* **State Propagation:** Whenever a context element changes, the engine propagates this to all relevant recipients. This could be done via events/signals or by maintaining a common blackboard that agents read from. For example, if the runtime context updates (say, internet connection restored), the engine will notify agents that had registered interest (perhaps all agents that had a promise contingent on internet availability are alerted so they can potentially resume normal operation). If an agent’s role changes (social context), any agent that was planning to delegate to the old role may need to refresh their info. State propagation ensures *consistency*: all parts of the system operate on the latest context, reducing errors like an agent working with stale assumptions.
* **Context and Promises:** The context engine also can enforce context-specific rules from promises. For instance, if an agent promised *“will not use internet if data is sensitive”*, and the task context is marked sensitive, the context engine can flag or even prevent the agent from calling the internet-access tool (this could be implemented by not exposing that tool in the runtime context for that agent). In this way, context and promises together provide both information and constraints to agents.

### 4.5 Memory Subsystem (ChromaDB + SQLite Hybrid)

Memory in this system is twofold: **vector-based semantic memory** and **structured long-term memory**.

* **Vector Memory (ChromaDB):** We integrate **ChromaDB** as a vector store to enable semantic search of past knowledge. Any textual data (documents, past conversations, code snippets, etc.) that might be relevant to agent reasoning is embedded (likely using an embedding model) and stored in ChromaDB with appropriate tags/metadata. This provides the “knowledge base” that agents draw from when building the Memory context. For example, previous design documents or stackoverflow Q\&As could be stored so that if the agent encounters a similar problem, it can retrieve those. ChromaDB offers persistent storage on disk for vectors, meaning the knowledge base can grow over time and survive restarts. The context engine’s memory retrieval will query ChromaDB using the current task description as the query vector to get semantically similar items.
* **Symbolic/Structured Memory (SQLite):** Some information is better stored in a structured manner (tables, key-value pairs). We use **SQLite** for things like configuration data, recently completed tasks, or any information where exact recall is needed rather than semantic similarity. SQLite acts as an **agent memory log** – agents can record what they did, decisions made, or key results in a relational form. For example, after a coding task, the agent might log in SQLite: (task\_id, code\_module\_name, test\_passed=True, timestamp). This allows querying such records precisely, like *“find last time this module’s tests failed.”* It’s also useful for storing any small data artifacts (e.g., a mapping of user stories to code modules) that agents need to share.
* **Memory Indexing and Update:** As agents work, they continuously update the memory. Any new important text (like a summary of a meeting, or an error message encountered and solved) gets embedded and added to ChromaDB for future reference. Key results or state changes go into SQLite. This dual storage ensures both **recall of specifics** and **discovery of related info** are possible. The orchestrator or a dedicated Memory Manager agent might periodically maintain these stores (clean up irrelevant info, re-embed updated documents, etc.).
* **Memory Access Patterns:** Agents access memory through the Context Engine interface – they don’t query Chroma or SQLite directly in most cases. For instance, when an agent enters a new subtask, the context engine will pre-fetch relevant memory (both semantic and explicit) and present it as part of the agent’s context. If an agent needs additional info, it can request it. Memory reads can be on-demand or proactively pushed when the context changes significantly (e.g., if a new requirement is added to task context, the engine might do another vector search for that requirement).
* **Example:** If the current task is “optimize the login function,” the context engine will query ChromaDB with “optimize login function” and maybe the code embedding of the login function, retrieving similar past tasks or known optimizations (perhaps an entry about “optimize search algorithm” if textually similar, which may or may not help – the agent can judge relevance). Simultaneously, SQLite might be queried for any records of “login function” (perhaps noting that *“in version 2.0, login was refactored for performance”*). The agent receives this as memory context and can use it to guide its approach. After completing the task, the agent stores a summary of what was done in SQLite and any new insights in Chroma.

### 4.6 Dual LLM Model Support (OpenAI API + LM Studio Local Models)

The system supports using two kinds of Large Language Model backends interchangeably: the OpenAI API (for powerful remote models) and **LM Studio** (for local models). This dual support provides flexibility between using cutting-edge models and running offline or on-premise.

* **Model Abstraction:** We define a model interface that agents use, abstracting whether the call goes to OpenAI or to a local model. For example, an agent calls something like `LLM.complete(prompt, model="default")` and the underlying system decides which model to route to based on configuration or context. The **default** might be set to OpenAI’s GPT-4 for high-quality outputs, but if the runtime context indicates offline mode or if cost is a concern, it might use a local model via LM Studio.
* **OpenAI API Integration:** For remote models (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5), we integrate with OpenAI’s API via the standard endpoints. This is useful for tasks needing the highest reasoning capabilities or large context windows.
* **LM Studio Integration:** **LM Studio** provides a way to run local LLMs and even offers an OpenAI-compatible API mode. We run an LM Studio server hosting a chosen local model (like a fine-tuned Llama2 or Mistral model). The system can send requests to this server similarly to how it would to OpenAI. By using OpenAI compatibility or the provided Python SDK, we minimize differences. This local model is used for cases such as: when data must remain internal (privacy), when internet is unavailable, or as a fallback if OpenAI API limits are reached. It could also be used concurrently for less complex tasks, reserving the OpenAI calls for the hardest problems.
* **Dynamic Model Selection:** The choice of model can be dynamic, driven by context or agent judgment. For instance, an agent might have a promise like *“will use local model for code generation unless complex reasoning is needed”*. If the agent finds the task straightforward, it might explicitly use the local model to save cost. Alternatively, if the task is extremely critical or ambiguous, it may use the more powerful OpenAI model. We can also allow **parallel prompting** – sending the same prompt to both models and comparing results or getting the local model’s result faster while waiting for the OpenAI result as a confirmation. This increases reliability (a form of redundancy).
* **Unified Output Handling:** Regardless of which model is used, the agent gets back a response in a standard format (probably just text or a structured JSON if we use function calling or structured prompting). The agent logic doesn’t have to drastically change per model. We do note that local models might have different strengths/weaknesses, so part of the agent’s adaptability could involve adjusting the prompt style or amount of context when using one vs the other.
* **Model Feedback:** Through DSPy or other evaluation, we track the quality of outputs from each model in different scenarios. Over time, the system might learn, for example, that *“the local model struggles with lengthy code reviews,”* so for that context it should always choose OpenAI. This learning can be encoded in the selection policy (perhaps even as additional meta-promises: *“I promise to only use GPT-4 for tasks involving legal text summarization”* if it’s known the local model isn’t good at that).

### 4.7 Feedback and Learning Loop (DSPy Integration)

Ensuring output quality and continuous improvement is handled by integrating **DSPy**-style feedback modules into agent workflows. DSPy provides a framework for assertions (hard checks) and suggestions (guidance for self-refinement) which we embed in our system as follows:

* **Assertions for Validation:** After an agent produces an output (be it code, text, a plan, etc.), the system can run a series of **assertions**. These are like unit tests or rules that the output must satisfy. For example, after code generation, assertions might be “the code compiles without error” or “the code includes function documentation”. If any assertion fails, the agent is alerted that it broke a rule. Assertions are tied to promises too (if an agent promised to follow a coding standard, there is likely an assertion to check that standard).
* **Suggestions for Refinement:** Instead of simply flagging errors, the system uses **suggestions** to help the agent improve the output. For instance, if a plan is missing a step, a suggestion might be: *“Consider adding a testing step as it’s often required.”* These suggestions can be generated by heuristic rules or even by another LLM pass (like a critique prompt). The agent can then incorporate these suggestions and retry the task, effectively iterating on its result. This mechanism enables a form of *dialectic reasoning* where the agent’s initial answer is not final; the agent engages with feedback (almost like having a conversation with a critic) to reach a better outcome.
* **Feedback Loop Implementation:** In practice, each agent (or certain critical agents like the Planner and Coder) might have an internal loop: generate initial output -> run it through a DSPy Module (which applies assertions and suggestions) -> if suggestions arise, optionally revise and repeat. We limit the number of iterations to avoid infinite loops, but even a couple of refinement cycles can significantly improve quality. The orchestrator can also enforce this loop at a higher level, e.g., not proceeding to the next graph node until either the output passes all assertions or a certain number of tries have been done.
* **Human Feedback:** DSPy concepts can extend to human-in-the-loop as well. If automated suggestions fail or are insufficient, the system could present the output and issues to a human via CLI or an interface, then incorporate their feedback in the next iteration. This might be important in SDLC for things like code reviews or architectural decisions.
* **Learning from Feedback:** Beyond the immediate refinement, the system stores the outcomes of these feedback loops. If an agent repeatedly needed a specific suggestion, it might update its own prompt or logic to include that insight from the start next time (thereby fulfilling the suggestion proactively). This is continuous learning. Additionally, failed assertions and how they were fixed can be logged to memory, building a knowledge base of common pitfalls and their solutions. Eventually, the agent might be able to anticipate issues (for example, the PlannerAgent might automatically include a testing step without needing the suggestion, because it learned that every plan got that suggestion).
* **Example:** After the CodeGen agent writes a function, an assertion fails because the function doesn’t handle an edge case. A suggestion is generated: *“Add input validation for negative numbers as the spec mentions that case.”* CodeGen sees this suggestion (the context engine can insert it into the task context as a new requirement), updates the code, and succeeds on the next run. This refinement loop ensures the final output meets the spec and the agent slightly adjusts its internal knowledge that “for this spec pattern, always include input validation.”

### 4.8 Agent Composition and Interaction

Summarizing how agents are built and how they interact in the unified architecture:

* **Agent Definition:** Each agent is defined in a modular way, possibly in a **structured spec format** (see Section 5). An agent definition includes its name, role, its promises, the modules it comprises, and any context dependencies (which context layers it heavily uses or requires). For example, an **ArchitectAgent** might be defined as needing task and memory context (for understanding requirements and past designs), promising to create high-level plans, and composed of a *RequirementAnalysisModule* and a *PlanningModule*. Such definitions serve as both documentation and configuration for instantiating the agent in the system.

* **Inter-Agent Communication:** Agents primarily communicate **indirectly** through the orchestrator (task graph) and shared context. That is, one agent’s output becomes another’s input via the task graph edges, and agents can also post information to the context (like leaving notes in memory or updating social context) that others pick up. In some cases, direct agent-to-agent messaging might be allowed (the social context could facilitate a direct query like Agent A asking Agent B a question). If so, those messages themselves should be treated as context updates (so they are logged and available to others if needed) and they should respect promises (e.g., an agent promised not to expose certain data will not do so in a message).

* **Orchestrator as Moderator:** The orchestrator plays the role of a moderator in multi-agent interactions. It assigns tasks, collects results, and can enforce that agents stick to their roles. If agents need to debate or discuss (dialectic reasoning across agents), the orchestrator might facilitate a structured conversation. For example, it could create a mini-workflow where two agents (say, a “Proposer” and a “Critic”) iteratively refine a design: Proposer outputs a plan, Critic reviews and suggests improvements (via context or direct message), Proposer revises, and so on for a few rounds. This is essentially implementing a reasoning dialectic between agents.

* **Tool Use:** Agents may call external tools (like compilers, linters, test runners) as part of their job. These tools can be wrapped as pseudo-agents or simply invoked via a secure interface. The runtime context will list what tools are available, and often an agent’s promise will mention tool usage (e.g., *“will use pylint for code analysis”*). The result of tool usage (e.g., compiler errors) goes back into context (perhaps tagged as feedback). Security and sandboxing are considered – e.g., code execution might be done in an isolated environment to prevent any harmful effects.

* **Error and Exception Handling:** If an agent throws an unexpected exception (say a bug in its code), the orchestrator can catch it and either retry, use a fallback agent, or escalate to human. Agents could also have a supervising module that catches and interprets errors. For example, if the CodeGen agent’s attempt to compile code results in a syntax error, instead of crashing, the error is captured and transformed into a context update (an assertion failure with suggestion to fix syntax). Thus, the system tries to handle errors gracefully within the agent reasoning process whenever possible, rather than simply aborting.

* **State and Logging:** All significant actions, decisions, and context changes are logged (to console output via CLI for the user to see, and to memory for record). This includes which agent did what, what was delegated, and any promise registrations or revocations. The logging format could be structured (JSON lines or similar) for easy parsing by tools/LLMs. This transparency not only helps humans follow along, but also allows an LLM agent to parse logs if we ever want an agent to analyze its own performance post-hoc.

**Remaining Gaps and Considerations:** In unifying the architecture, a few areas need careful thought:

* **Consistency of Data:** Ensuring that the **Context Engine** and **Promise Broker** remain single sources of truth. We must avoid situations where agent A’s view of context differs from agent B’s. Race conditions in context updates should be handled (e.g., using locks or an event queue in implementation).
* **Performance Overhead:** The layers introduced (promise checks, context queries, feedback loops) add overhead. We should identify places to optimize (caching context queries, perhaps simplifying promise matching with indices or categories).
* **Two-Stage vs Unified:** The original two-stage specification likely separated a “planning stage” and an “execution stage”. In this refined design, those blend together – planning is just another task graph that may involve execution as sub-nodes. We should ensure this unification doesn’t lose clarity. One way is to maintain a concept of **phases** in the workflow (e.g., Phase 1: Plan, Phase 2: Execute), but still use one orchestration graph that encompasses both. The agents involved in planning could be different from those in execution, but the hand-off is through context (the plan becomes part of task context for execution phase).
* **Security and Misuse of Promises:** We assume agents are truthful in promises. If an agent (or a faulty prompt) violates a promise, how do we safeguard? Perhaps by design, critical promises (like “will not do destructive action”) are enforced by external checks (sandboxing, OS permissions) to complement the voluntary promise approach.
* **Debugging Tools:** A future extension is to build a UI or DSL to visualize or simulate the spec. For now, we rely on structured logs and the introspection API.

## 5. Unified Specification Format and Example

To ensure the specification is accessible to both human developers and LLM-based agents, we propose writing it in a **structured Markdown** format, augmented with clear sections and possibly machine-readable fragments. Markdown is easily readable, and with consistent headings and syntax, an LLM can also navigate it.

Alternatively, for a more formal machine-readable spec, a **TOML + commentary** approach could be used. We illustrate the structured Markdown approach here, as it balances readability and structure.

**Specification Outline in Markdown:**

* Each major component or concept is a top-level heading (e.g., “Agents”, “Context Engine”, “Promises”).
* Under each, sub-sections detail the subcomponents or properties.
* Lists and tables are used for enumerations of capabilities or fields.
* Concrete example snippets are given in fenced code blocks (which could be tagged as JSON/TOML if representing data).

For example, an agent specification in this Markdown might look like:

```markdown
### Agent: CodeGen

**Description:** An agent that generates source code from specifications.

**Promises:**
- *Capabilities:* Generate code in multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript) given a design or specification.
- *Conditions:* Requires an up-to-date Task context with feature requirements; needs Memory context with coding standards.
- *Will NOT:* Modify existing code without review; will not access the internet (operates offline on local data).
- *Quality:* Promises to run basic linting on generated code and fix issues before output.

**Modules:**
- PlannerModule – plans the structure of the code (e.g., outline classes/functions).
- WriterModule – uses an LLM to write code for each part.
- TesterModule – (optional) can run a quick syntax check or provided unit tests.

**Context Dependencies:** Task, Memory, Runtime (for available libraries/tools).

**Interactions:** Delegates to a TesterAgent if thorough testing is required (sees TesterAgent’s promise).
```

In a more machine-readable vein, we could express the same in TOML like:

```toml
[[agent]]
name = "CodeGen"
description = "Generates source code from specifications."

   [agent.promises]
   capabilities = "Generate code (Python, JS) from design spec"
   conditions = "Task context with requirements; Memory context with standards"
   will_not = "Modify existing code without review; use internet"
   quality = "Will run lint and fix issues before providing code"

   [agent.modules]
   planner = "PlannerModule"
   writer  = "WriterModule"
   tester  = "TesterModule (optional)"

   [agent.context_dependencies]
   requires = ["Task", "Memory", "Runtime"]

   [agent.delegation]
   delegates_to = "TesterAgent"  # if thorough testing needed
```

This TOML snippet is accompanied by Markdown explanations for each field. Such a format can be parsed by an LLM or by a simple script to extract configuration. It provides an unambiguous schema for agent definitions, making it easier for both machines and humans to verify the spec.

**Separation of Abstract vs Concrete:** In the specification, we explicitly separate abstract patterns from concrete implementations. For example:

* In a section describing the **context model** (abstract concept), we explain the idea of layered context and influences (as we did in Section 2). Then a following section or sub-section on **context engine implementation** will detail how we realize it with specific tech (Context Engine module, methods, data stores).
* This document uses notes like “(abstract)” or “(implementation)” where needed to label the nature of decisions. Developers reading it can understand the rationale, and LLMs can avoid confusing the concept with one particular implementation.

**Including Examples:** The spec liberally includes examples (in text or pseudo-code) to illustrate how a concept works in practice. This ensures that any reader or LLM agent trying to follow the spec can grasp the intended usage. For instance, when we talk about a promise being modified at runtime, we included an example scenario of an API agent losing connectivity and revoking a promise. These examples are clearly set off (using italics or a blockquote or “Example:” prefix) to distinguish them from normative spec requirements.

**LLM-Specific DSL (Optional):** In the future, we might design a simple DSL that LLM agents can use to interpret instructions from the spec. For now, sticking to Markdown/TOML is sufficient, but we remain open to evolving this. For instance, an LLM-specific DSL might allow an agent to query the spec like a knowledge base (e.g., ask “What does CodeGen agent promise regarding quality?” and the DSL format makes it easy to parse the answer). This is an open area for extension.

## 6. Example Walk-Through

To demonstrate the unified system, consider an end-to-end example where the user invokes the CLI to add a new feature to a project:

* **User Input (CLI):** `sdlc_agent plan --feature "Add forgot password flow"`
  The CLI (Typer) parses this and validates that "feature" is provided. It then calls the Orchestrator with a structured `FeatureSpec` object for "Add forgot password flow".

* **Orchestrator (LangGraph):** Based on this request, it creates a workflow graph. The graph might include:

  1. **RequirementsAgent** node – to analyze the feature request and break it down (ensuring the Task context is well-defined).
  2. **DesignAgent** node – to outline a high-level solution (perhaps sequence diagrams, module impact).
  3. **CodeGenAgent** node – to implement the code changes.
  4. **TesterAgent** node – to run tests on the new code.
  5. **ReviewerAgent** node – to review the changes.
     Each arrow passes outputs (e.g., requirements -> design -> code -> test results -> review).

* **Context & Promises Setup:** Initially, the Context Engine sets up an initial Task context (“Add forgot password flow” details) and Memory context (it may retrieve similar feature additions like “reset password” from the past). Social context has the roster of available agents (which all have registered promises: DesignAgent promises design docs, CodeGenAgent promises code, etc.). The orchestrator picks the RequirementsAgent for the first node because that agent promised ability to parse feature requests (capability match found via Promise Broker).

* **Execution:**

  1. *RequirementsAgent* reads the Task context (the feature description) and Memory (perhaps finds a style guide for features). It outputs a refined list of requirements (e.g., “User can request reset link, system sends email, user can reset via link, etc.”). It updates Task context with this structured requirement list.
  2. *DesignAgent* sees updated Task context (requirements) and uses that to create a design. Memory context might supply architecture guidelines. Suppose runtime context says “no internet” – but DesignAgent had a promise to possibly fetch external design patterns if available, now it can’t, so it works offline (the agent adapts, possibly noted by context). It outputs a design (maybe pseudo-code or component list), updating Task context.
  3. *CodeGenAgent* is up. It sees Task context (requirements + design) and Memory (coding standards, maybe similar code from the past). It decides to use OpenAI model due to complexity of the feature (runtime context allows it). It generates code. After generation, before outputting, it runs its internal TesterModule for a quick check (linting) – an assertion fails (it forgot to handle an edge case). A suggestion is given (via DSPy feedback: “Include check for empty email input”). CodeGenAgent revises the code accordingly and passes all internal checks. It outputs the code (this goes into the context or perhaps directly as an artifact).
  4. *TesterAgent* receives the new code (perhaps via the Memory or as an attachment in context). It runs the test suite. It might clone itself if the test suite is large (parallelize by module). Suppose one test fails indicating an email not sent scenario. The TesterAgent logs the failure in Task context and possibly suggests a fix (it might not fix it, but it notes *“Test X failed: no email sent when requested”*).
  5. The orchestrator sees the test failure. According to the workflow, maybe it should loop back to CodeGenAgent for a fix. Or it might spawn a DebuggerAgent. For simplicity, CodeGenAgent is invoked again with the context that tests failed and the specific issue (this is new Task context info). CodeGenAgent, upon seeing this, acknowledges it missed that scenario. It generates a fix (maybe a quick patch to send the email, using local model this time since it’s a minor addition). It updates the code. The tests run again (TesterAgent re-runs just the failed test perhaps) and now pass.
  6. *ReviewerAgent* now takes the final code and summary of testing. It uses an LLM to review if the code meets quality and requirements. It might have seen in memory that a similar feature had a security concern, so it double-checks that (thanks to Memory context). The reviewer approves and maybe adds a comment in the context *“Looks good. Consider adding logging for email sends.”* That’s a suggestion but not a blocker, so the process can end or hand off to user.

* **Completion:** The CLI then prints out the result: maybe the final code diff, test results, and reviewer notes. All along, each step’s decisions and changes were logged. The user (or an LLM analyzing this process) can follow the trace with references to which agent did what, which promises were used (e.g., *CodeGenAgent fulfilled its promise to run lint checks; TesterAgent’s promise of catching failures led to a revision*), and how context influenced outcomes (e.g., *“because offline, design did not use external patterns”*).

This walk-through shows the system in action, highlighting promise-based delegation, layered contexts in use, runtime adaptation (model switching, loopbacks, cloning), and the unified orchestration keeping it all together.

## 7. Future Extensions and Open Questions

While this specification provides a comprehensive design, there are open questions and potential research avenues to further enhance the system:

* **Automated Promise Evolution:** How can agents automatically refine their promises over time? We described manual or triggered updates, but one could research letting agents analyze their performance logs and then adjust their advertised promises (e.g., becoming more specific or relaxing promises that were too strict). Ensuring these evolved promises remain consistent and do not conflict is a challenge – perhaps a learning algorithm or governance policy is needed.

* **Formal Verification of Promises:** Promise Theory in our context is informal (based on natural language or simple conditions). Future work could add a formal layer – using logic or a domain-specific language to specify promises and even **verify** agent behavior against them. If an agent is code-based, techniques from software verification could check if, say, the agent’s code respects the “will not do X” conditions. This would increase trust, especially for critical tasks.

* **Advanced Context Reasoning:** Our context engine enables basic interplay of context. Research could explore more advanced cognitive architectures – for example, integrating something like a **global workspace theory** (where different context “experts” compete/cooperate and only the most relevant info gets “conscious” focus) to manage which context is most salient at a time. Also, conflict resolution strategies between contexts (if two layers provide contradictory information, how to resolve systematically? Perhaps using another agent as a mediator or default precedence rules).

* **Inter-Agent Dialogue & Dialectic Chains:** We touched on dialectic reasoning (like an internal critique loop, or two agents debating). One could extend this so that for any non-trivial decision, the system might *always* spawn a pair of agents (or a multi-agent discussion) to evaluate alternatives – akin to having a “Red Team/Blue Team” or a “devil’s advocate” agent. This could improve robustness but at the cost of more computation. Understanding when such dialectic processes are worth it is an open area. It might tie into promises (maybe an agent promises to always self-criticize via an internal sub-agent before finalizing decisions).

* **Memory Scaling and Forgetting:** As the system is used over time, the memory stores will grow. Strategies for **forgetting** or compressing knowledge will be needed to keep retrieval efficient and relevant. For example, automatically summarizing or pruning older logs that are no longer relevant to current projects, or clustering similar past tasks and keeping only a representative example. How to do this without losing valuable info is an open question. Perhaps an “Memory Curator” agent could be introduced.

* **User Intent and Control:** In a complex automated SDLC, ensuring the user’s intentions are correctly understood and executed is paramount. Research into better interfaces (natural language to specify preferences for the agents, or a GUI to adjust the plan on the fly) could improve the developer experience. Also, how can a developer override or guide the AI’s decisions mid-process if needed? For instance, a developer might want to say “stop using the local model, use GPT-4 for this part” – currently, they’d tweak config or re-run with a flag. A more interactive control mechanism could be explored.

* **Extending to Other Domains:** While this spec is framed for SDLC (planning, coding, testing, etc.), the modular design is domain-agnostic. Open question: what domain-specific adjustments would be needed to apply this to, say, IT operations automation or scientific research assistance? Likely the promise types and context layers would be similar, but the tools and some agent roles would change. This generalizability is a sign of a robust architecture, but validation in other domains would be insightful.

* **LLM Limitations and Safety:** Relying on LLMs (especially for critical tasks like code generation or decision-making) carries risk of errors or unsafe outputs. We partly mitigate this via feedback and constraints, but ongoing research in prompt robustness, adversarial input handling, and aligning LLM outputs with developer values can further strengthen the system. For example, integrating a safety-scoring agent that reviews any action before execution (like preventing any code that performs file deletion unless explicitly intended) could be worth adding.

In conclusion, this refined specification provides a **unified, implementable blueprint** for a modular CLI-based multi-agent system tailored to software development tasks. It marries **promise-driven cooperation** with **context-aware intelligence** and **adaptive architectures** to create an agent ecosystem that is transparent, flexible, and extensible. By adhering to minimalism and clear module boundaries, developers can gradually build and trust this system, while the system itself can grow in capabilities by learning from each interaction. The next steps involve translating this specification into actual code modules and iteratively testing the assumptions in real-world usage, guided by the open questions above. With careful implementation, this system could significantly accelerate and enhance the software development life cycle while maintaining reliability and developer control.
