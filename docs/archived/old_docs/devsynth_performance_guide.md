## 1. Introduction

This guide provides strategies and best practices for optimizing the performance of DevSynth, particularly regarding token usage, resource utilization, and response time. DevSynth is designed to run efficiently on a developer's local machine, and these optimization techniques will help ensure optimal performance.

Performance optimization in DevSynth focuses on three key areas:

1. **Token Usage**: Minimizing the number of tokens used in LLM interactions to reduce costs and improve response times
2. **Resource Usage**: Optimizing memory, CPU, and disk usage to ensure DevSynth runs efficiently on the developer's machine
3. **LM Studio Configuration**: Configuring LM Studio for optimal performance with DevSynth

## 2. Token Usage Optimization

### 2.1 Understanding Token Usage

Tokens are the basic units of text processed by language models. Each token represents a piece of text, typically a word or part of a word. Understanding how tokens work is essential for optimizing DevSynth's performance:

- **Token Count**: The number of tokens in a text is roughly 3/4 the number of words
- **Context Window**: LLMs have a limited context window (e.g., 4096 tokens for many models)
- **Cost Factors**: Both input (prompt) and output (completion) tokens contribute to costs
- **Performance Impact**: Larger token counts lead to slower inference times

DevSynth tracks token usage for all operations and provides reports to help you optimize your workflows.

### 2.2 Context Pruning Strategies

Context pruning reduces the amount of context information sent to the LLM, which saves tokens and improves performance:

#### Relevance-Based Pruning

DevSynth implements relevance-based pruning to keep only the most relevant context for the current task:

```yaml
# Enable relevance-based pruning in config.yaml
tokens:
  context_pruning:
    strategy: relevance
    threshold: 0.7  # Relevance threshold (0-1)
```

#### Recency-Based Pruning

Recent context is often more relevant than older context:

```yaml
# Enable recency-based pruning in config.yaml
tokens:
  context_pruning:
    strategy: recency
    max_age: 3600  # Maximum age in seconds
```

#### Priority-Based Pruning

Certain types of context have higher priority:

```yaml
# Enable priority-based pruning in config.yaml
tokens:
  context_pruning:
    strategy: priority
    priorities:
      requirements: high
      tests: medium
      code: medium
      documentation: low
```

#### Summarization

For large contexts, summarization can significantly reduce token usage:

```yaml
# Enable summarization in config.yaml
tokens:
  context_pruning:
    strategy: summarization
    max_tokens: 1000  # Maximum tokens per context section
```

### 2.3 Prompt Optimization Techniques

Optimizing prompts can significantly reduce token usage:

#### Template Trimming

DevSynth automatically trims prompt templates to remove unnecessary parts:

```yaml
# Enable template trimming in config.yaml
tokens:
  prompt_optimization:
    template_trimming: true
```

#### Example Reduction

Limiting the number of examples in prompts:

```yaml
# Configure example reduction in config.yaml
tokens:
  prompt_optimization:
    max_examples: 2
```

#### Instruction Compression

Making instructions more concise:

```yaml
# Enable instruction compression in config.yaml
tokens:
  prompt_optimization:
    instruction_compression: true
```

#### Chunked Generation

Breaking large prompts into smaller chunks:

```yaml
# Enable chunked generation in config.yaml
tokens:
  prompt_optimization:
    chunked_generation: true
    chunk_size: 1000  # Maximum tokens per chunk
```

### 2.4 Response Processing Optimization

Optimizing how responses are processed can improve performance:

#### Streaming Processing

Processing responses as they are generated:

```yaml
# Enable streaming processing in config.yaml
tokens:
  response_optimization:
    streaming: true
```

#### Incremental Parsing

Parsing responses incrementally to save memory:

```yaml
# Enable incremental parsing in config.yaml
tokens:
  response_optimization:
    incremental_parsing: true
```

#### Early Termination

Stopping generation when sufficient information is obtained:

```yaml
# Enable early termination in config.yaml
tokens:
  response_optimization:
    early_termination: true
    termination_patterns:
      - "```"  # Stop when code block ends
      - "END OF RESPONSE"
```

## 3. Resource Usage Optimization

### 3.1 Memory Management

DevSynth is designed to use minimal memory, but there are ways to further optimize memory usage:

#### Context Size Limits

Limit the size of context stored in memory:

```yaml
# Configure context size limits in config.yaml
memory:
  max_context_size: 10000  # Maximum tokens in context
```

#### Garbage Collection

Force garbage collection after large operations:

```yaml
# Enable aggressive garbage collection in config.yaml
memory:
  aggressive_gc: true
```

#### Memory Monitoring

Monitor memory usage and get alerts when it exceeds thresholds:

```yaml
# Configure memory monitoring in config.yaml
memory:
  monitoring:
    enabled: true
    threshold: 500  # MB
```

### 3.2 CPU Utilization

Optimize CPU usage for better performance:

#### Parallel Processing

Enable parallel processing for certain operations:

```yaml
# Configure parallel processing in config.yaml
cpu:
  parallel_processing:
    enabled: true
    max_workers: 4  # Maximum number of worker threads
```

#### Process Priority

Set process priority for DevSynth:

```yaml
# Configure process priority in config.yaml
cpu:
  process_priority: normal  # low, normal, high
```

#### Background Operations

Run resource-intensive operations in the background:

```yaml
# Enable background operations in config.yaml
cpu:
  background_operations: true
```

### 3.3 Disk I/O

Optimize disk I/O for better performance:

#### Caching

Cache frequently accessed files:

```yaml
# Configure file caching in config.yaml
disk:
  caching:
    enabled: true
    max_size: 100  # MB
```

#### Asynchronous I/O

Use asynchronous I/O for file operations:

```yaml
# Enable asynchronous I/O in config.yaml
disk:
  async_io: true
```

#### Compression

Compress stored data to reduce disk usage:

```yaml
# Enable data compression in config.yaml
disk:
  compression:
    enabled: true
    level: 6  # Compression level (1-9)
```

## 4. LM Studio Optimization

### 4.1 Model Selection

Choosing the right model is crucial for performance:

#### Model Size vs. Performance

- **Small Models** (1B-3B parameters): Fast, low resource usage, but less capable
- **Medium Models** (7B-13B parameters): Good balance of performance and capability
- **Large Models** (30B+ parameters): Most capable, but require significant resources

Recommended models for different use cases:

| Use Case | Recommended Model | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Quick prototyping | Llama 3 8B | Fast, good quality |
| Code generation | CodeLlama 7B | Specialized for code |
| Detailed specifications | Mistral 7B | Good reasoning capabilities |
| Resource-constrained systems | Phi-2 2.7B | Very efficient |

#### Dynamic Model Selection

DevSynth can dynamically select models based on the task complexity:

```yaml
# Configure dynamic model selection in config.yaml
llm:
  dynamic_model_selection:
    enabled: true
    models:
      simple: "Phi-2 2.7B"
      medium: "Llama 3 8B"
      complex: "CodeLlama 13B"
```

### 4.2 Inference Parameters

Optimize inference parameters in LM Studio:

#### Temperature

Lower temperature values (0.1-0.4) produce more deterministic outputs and are often faster:

```yaml
# Configure temperature in config.yaml
llm:
  temperature: 0.2
```

#### Top-P and Top-K

Adjust sampling parameters for better performance:

```yaml
# Configure sampling parameters in config.yaml
llm:
  top_p: 0.9
  top_k: 40
```

#### Max Tokens

Limit the maximum number of tokens generated:

```yaml
# Configure max tokens in config.yaml
llm:
  max_tokens: 1000
```

### 4.3 Hardware Acceleration

Leverage hardware acceleration for better performance:

#### GPU Acceleration

If available, use GPU acceleration in LM Studio:

1. In LM Studio, go to Settings
2. Enable GPU acceleration
3. Select the appropriate device

#### CPU Optimization

Optimize CPU settings in LM Studio:

1. In LM Studio, go to Settings
2. Adjust the number of threads based on your CPU
3. Enable CPU optimizations if available

## 6. Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### High Token Usage

If you're experiencing high token usage:

1. Check token usage reports to identify the operations consuming the most tokens
2. Enable context pruning strategies
3. Optimize prompt templates
4. Use smaller models for simpler tasks
5. Implement chunked generation for large inputs

### Slow Response Times

If DevSynth is responding slowly:

1. Check system resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk)
2. Use a smaller, faster model in LM Studio
3. Adjust inference parameters (lower temperature, lower max_tokens)
4. Enable hardware acceleration if available
5. Close other resource-intensive applications

### High Memory Usage

If DevSynth is using too much memory:

1. Limit context size
2. Enable aggressive garbage collection
3. Use smaller models
4. Implement incremental processing
5. Monitor memory usage and identify memory leaks
