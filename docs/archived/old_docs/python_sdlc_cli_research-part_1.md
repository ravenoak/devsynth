Great. I’ll start designing a specification for a modular, agent-based SDLC orchestration framework using LangGraph and OpenAI, focused initially on Python with BDD/TDD practices and dialectical development workflows. The system will prioritize CLI-based UX, use best practices across software disciplines, and include persistence/logging with embedded databases. It will identify opportunities to reuse or extend open-source tools and suggest solutions for any gaps.

I’ll get back to you with a detailed architecture, agent breakdown, recommended libraries, and a spec to begin implementation.


# Modular AI SDLC Orchestration Framework Specification

## Introduction

In modern software engineering, there is growing interest in using AI agents to assist or even automate parts of the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle). Recent frameworks like ChatDev and MetaGPT have demonstrated **multi-agent collaboration** for software development – for example, ChatDev organizes agents in roles (CEO, CTO, programmer, tester, etc.) to cooperatively design, code, test, and document a project. MetaGPT similarly simulates a “software company in a box” with GPT-4 agents acting as product managers, architects, engineers, and QA, following standard operating procedures to generate requirements, designs, code, **diagrams**, and tests. These systems show the potential of **collaborative AI** in development, but they also highlight challenges around orchestration, reliability, and developer control.

Enter our proposed **LangGraph + OpenAI-based SDLC Orchestrator** – a modular framework that leverages OpenAI’s powerful LLMs (e.g. GPT-4) and the LangGraph agent framework to enable dialectical, iterative software development assistance. LangGraph is an open-source library that uses **graph-based architectures** to model complex AI agent workflows with explicit state management. It supports *stateful graphs* (nodes as agents/tools with memory) and even cyclical loops in the workflow, allowing agents to revisit steps iteratively. This foundation is ideal for implementing an iterative “expand, differentiate, refine” development loop with multiple specialized agents. The system we specify will coordinate agents that generate design artifacts, specifications, tests, and code in cycles, all while enforcing BDD/TDD best practices and keeping a human developer **in the loop** for oversight.

**Vision:** The goal is to create a **collaborative AI development assistant** that experienced developers and system designers can use via a rich CLI. It should accelerate development by handling boilerplate and analysis tasks, improve quality by writing thorough tests and performing validations, and maintain high transparency so that human developers remain in control. Unlike a monolithic “AI writes all the code” approach, this framework emphasizes *dialectical* progress – agents will propose solutions and critique/refine them in a back-and-forth manner (inspired by techniques like dual-agent debates and self-reflection). The outcome is a systematic, modular pipeline that can be extended to multiple programming languages and artifact types, integrating seamlessly with real-world development workflows.

## Goals and Key Requirements

The following are the primary objectives and features of the orchestration framework:

* **Iterative Development Loop (“Expand, Differentiate, Refine”):** The system will guide software development through repeating cycles of **expansion** (adding new ideas, tests, or code), **differentiation** (analyzing outcomes, finding discrepancies or failures), and **refinement** (improving or fixing the artifacts). This echoes the thesis→antithesis→synthesis dialectic, ensuring continuous improvement rather than one-shot generation. Each cycle should produce measurable progress (e.g. a new passing test, a fixed bug, a refined design).

* **Behavior-Driven and Test-Driven Development (BDD/TDD):** All work is anchored by tests and specifications. Behavior-driven development means high-level requirements are turned into human-readable scenarios (e.g. Gherkin **Given/When/Then** style) before coding. Test-driven development means the system will generate tests (behavior tests or unit tests) for a feature **first**, then generate code to satisfy those tests. The framework must produce **Gherkin feature files** for user-facing behavior and **unit/integration tests** for internal logic, and only consider coding tasks “done” when tests pass. This ensures that the AI-generated code is always validated against defined acceptance criteria.

* **LangGraph Orchestration & OpenAI LLMs:** Utilize LangGraph to define the workflow as a **stateful graph of agent nodes**. Each node (agent) handles a specific responsibility (design, test generation, coding, etc.), and edges define the flow, including conditional branches (e.g. if a test fails, go to refine code) and loops for iteration. LangGraph’s runtime will manage agent execution order, state passing, and loop conditions. The agents themselves will use OpenAI’s GPT-4 (or similar) via API for their reasoning and generation tasks. The framework should also allow plugging in alternative LLM backends if needed, but OpenAI’s models are the default for their capability.

* **Modularity and Extensibility:** The system must be **modular**, enabling support for multiple programming languages and file types through well-defined interfaces. While Python 3.11 is the baseline (with project environment managed by **Poetry 2.1.3**), the design will accommodate adding agents or templates for other languages (TypeScript, Rust, C++, etc.) and other artifact types (Dockerfiles, Kubernetes YAML, shell scripts, etc.). For instance, one should be able to register a “Code Generation” agent specialized for Rust that uses a Rust-specific LLM prompt and yields `.rs` files, or a “Deployment Artifact Generator” for Dockerfiles. The framework should provide language-agnostic abstractions where possible (e.g. a generic Test Writer interface) and make it easy to extend with new language modules.

* **User-Friendly CLI:** Provide a command-line interface that is intuitive for developers. The CLI should offer commands to initialize a project, run an iteration of the AI development loop, review changes, and incorporate them. A rich text output is expected – use formatting (colors, indentation, etc.) to distinguish AI messages, highlights, warnings, and so on. For example, when the AI generates a test, the CLI might print it in green, and when a test fails, print the failure in red. The CLI might have subcommands such as `init`, `spec`, `bdd`, `code`, `test`, `refine`, or a unified interactive mode where the user issues high-level intents (“add feature X”) and the tool runs the appropriate agents. Under the hood, libraries like **Rich** or **Textual** can be used to enhance the terminal UX (progress spinners, tables for summary, etc.). The CLI should also handle configuration (selecting target language, model parameters, etc.) and support **step-by-step execution with confirmations**, so a user can choose to proceed or adjust after each stage.

* **Security and Quality by Design:** All generated artifacts and actions must adhere to software engineering best practices. This includes:

  * *Secure Coding:* The system should have mechanisms to avoid introducing secrets or vulnerabilities in generated code. For example, if the AI writes code that handles passwords or keys, it should flag and prompt for proper secret management. It should run security linters (like Bandit for Python) on code agents’ output and have an internal knowledge base of common security pitfalls. Any code execution done by the agents (e.g. running tests) should be sandboxed – for example, running in a subprocess with limited permissions or inside a container – to prevent malicious side effects from hallucinated code.
  * *Code Quality:* Agents must output code that is clean and maintainable. Enforce style guides (using formatters like Black, isort) and linters (flake8, pylint) automatically as part of the refine cycle. The code generation agent should also structure code following good architecture practices (for instance, if generating a web app, separate layers appropriately, avoid huge functions, etc.). We will integrate static analyzers and type checkers (e.g. mypy for Python, or Rust’s compiler for Rust code) into the workflow to catch errors early.
  * *Architecture & Design:* The specification and design agents should follow solid architectural principles (e.g. SOLID, abstraction, modular design). If a design or spec is updated, the system ensures consistency (the code and tests align with the spec). The **Diagram synthesis agent** can produce **UML or architecture diagrams** to help visualize the design, and these diagrams serve as a guide for maintaining structured architecture. If possible, incorporate model validation tools (for example, if a UML component diagram is produced, use a validator to ensure no missing relations).
  * *Testing & Verification:* Testing is deeply ingrained (both BDD and TDD aspects). Additionally, the framework should track code coverage of generated tests. If coverage is low or critical paths are untested, the test generation agent should attempt to create additional tests. For verification, we consider formal reasoning in the loop – e.g., using a static analysis or even formal methods tool for critical logic. (For instance, for a security-critical module, the validation agent might invoke a model checker or a symbolic executor as a tool to prove certain properties). All this ensures the AI’s output is not only correct on the happy path but also robust.

* **Persistent State & Logging:** The orchestration process will maintain a persistent **state store** to record the project’s knowledge and the agents’ context. This is critical for multi-step workflows because the AI agents will generate and refine content over multiple sessions. We will use an **embedded database** (for example, SQLite) or lightweight document store to save:

  * Current specification and requirements.
  * Generated test cases (with their status: pass/fail).
  * Generated code files (possibly versioned, or at least the last accepted version).
  * Activity logs of each agent’s actions and decisions (including prompt inputs/outputs if possible, for audit/debugging).
  * Metadata like which cycle we are in, what was done in previous cycles (this helps an agent decide what to do next).
    This persistent state allows stopping and resuming the development process without losing context. It also aids transparency: developers can inspect the history of changes and rationales. For observability, the framework will implement comprehensive logging – both human-readable logs (shown in CLI or saved to log files with timestamps) and structured logs (e.g. JSON records in the DB). **LangGraph** inherently provides state tracking (its “stateful graph” records data as it moves through nodes), and our design builds on that by making the state persistent across runs. We may also integrate with **LangSmith** or similar observability tools for LLM applications to visualize the chain of events and track errors.

* **Agent Tool Access and Open-Source Integration:** Each agent will have access to a suite of **tools** to perform actions beyond pure text generation. For example, an agent might call a *filesystem tool* to write or read code files, a *test runner tool* to execute the test suite, a *web search or documentation lookup tool* to gather information, or a *shell tool* to execute commands (like running `docker build` to verify a Dockerfile). The framework should leverage **LangGraph’s tool integration** (or LangChain’s tooling if applicable) to give agents these abilities safely. We emphasize reusing mature open-source libraries wherever possible:

  * For **diagram generation**, use standard formats like Mermaid or PlantUML. The diagram agent could output a Mermaid markdown diagram, which we can render or include in documentation (MetaGPT did something similar using Mermaid for UML). We might incorporate a library (or CLI tool) to render the diagram and save an image for the user.
  * For **BDD tests**, use known frameworks (e.g. Cucumber or Behave for Gherkin). The behavior test agent can produce `.feature` files in Gherkin syntax and also stub step definition code. If the target language is Python, we integrate with Behave or pytest-bdd; for JavaScript, Cucumber.js, etc. The agent could also call a tool that generates step definitions from Gherkin steps for convenience.
  * For **unit tests**, use the standard testing framework of the language (pytest/unittest for Python, Jest for JS, Rust’s cargo test, etc.). The agent writes test code accordingly. Optionally, incorporate property-based testing tools (like Hypothesis in Python) for more thorough test generation.
  * For **code generation**, aside from the LLM, use helper libraries for specific tasks – e.g. use a OpenAPI generator if the spec requires a REST API (the spec agent could produce an OpenAPI spec, and a codegen tool could scaffold a lot of the boilerplate).
  * For **refactoring**, we can tap into linters and formatters as mentioned, and possibly AST-based refactoring tools (like `rope` for Python, or Rust’s `rustfmt` suggestions). If complex refactoring or migration is needed, an agent could leverage frameworks like 2to3 (for Py2 to Py3) or etc., instead of relying purely on LLM.
  * Each agent’s design should encourage using such tools first (for reliability) and only use the LLM for the creative or reasoning part. For instance, **Uber’s Developer Platform** found success using a *network of agents to automate unit test generation* as part of codebase migration – our test-writing agent should likewise integrate with existing code to generate tests rather than hallucinating all context.

* **Human Review and Control:** A fundamental requirement is that **no changes are applied to the codebase without human approval**. The developer remains the final authority. The framework will present the results of each step to the user for review:

  * When the specification or user stories are generated or updated, show them to the user to confirm that they reflect the intended requirements.
  * When new BDD scenarios are created, allow the user to edit or approve them.
  * When code is generated or refactored, the system will produce a **diff** (difference) against the current code. The CLI can show this diff (possibly with unified diff formatting and syntax highlight) for the user to inspect. The user can then accept the changes, reject them, or ask for further refinement (possibly by giving a quick feedback prompt to the agent).
  * Only upon approval does the framework write the changes to the project files (committing them to the state). Optionally, we integrate with version control (git): e.g. the tool could automatically commit each accepted change-set with a message (perhaps generated by the spec agent for consistency). This way, the human and AI collaboration is documented in git history.
  * At any point, the user should be able to intervene with **natural language instructions** as well. For example, “Add a scenario where the user enters an invalid password” or “Use a factory pattern here instead of constructing directly.” The CLI could accept such user instructions and feed them into the appropriate agent (perhaps via the orchestrator agent) in the next cycle.
  * This human-in-the-loop approach is critical for safety and aligns with LangGraph’s philosophy of **HITL** (human-in-the-loop) for important decisions. Indeed, real-world implementations like Replit’s Ghostwriter agent system expose agent actions to users and wait for confirmation, rather than executing blindly. Our framework will follow this best practice to ensure developers trust the AI assistance and can correct its course as needed.

With these goals established, we now detail the system architecture and components that will fulfill them.

## Architecture Overview

**Overall Structure:** The framework is organized as a **pipeline of specialized AI agents** working together under a coordinating orchestrator (the “supervisor”). The orchestration logic is defined as a directed graph (using LangGraph) where nodes represent agent tasks and edges represent transitions or dependencies. This graph is not strictly linear – it contains branches and **loops** to facilitate the iterative refine cycles. The high-level workflow can be visualized as follows:

&#x20;*Figure: Example multi-agent role structure (from MetaGPT). Each agent role (e.g., ProductManager for specs, Architect for design, Engineer for code, QA for testing) handles a part of the SDLC, and they collaborate as a team. Our framework will similarly assign distinct agent modules to tasks like specification, testing, coding, etc., orchestrated in a unified workflow.*

At a top level, the orchestration graph will include phases corresponding to **Plan/Design**, **Development**, and **Validation** – but importantly, these are not one-off sequential phases (as in a pure waterfall). Instead, within each phase, the system continuously cycles through *expand → differentiate → refine* until the acceptance criteria for that phase are met, then moves to the next. To clarify:

* **Expand:** in this step, the system expands the scope or detail of the project. For example, in a fresh project, the Specification Agent might expand on an idea into a detailed requirements spec. Or in a development iteration, the Behavior Test Agent might add a new scenario (expanding test coverage), or the Code Agent might generate a new module implementing a feature. “Expand” introduces something new based on the current goals. It’s akin to generating the *thesis* in a dialectic cycle (a proposal of what to do next).

* **Differentiate:** now the system evaluates the differences between the expected outcome and the current state. This often involves running tests or analysis. For instance, after code is generated or changed, the Test Execution (Validation) Agent runs the test suite to see which tests fail – those failing tests *differentiate* between the intended behavior and the implementation. Or if a design diagram was updated, the differentiate step might compare it against the spec to find mismatches. Essentially, this is the *feedback* stage – highlighting conflicts, errors, or unmet requirements. In TDD terms, this is seeing red test failures (which is good, as it identifies what must be refined). In dialectic terms, it’s the *antithesis* – the critique of the proposed solution.

* **Refine:** given the feedback from differentiate, the system now refines the artifacts to better align with requirements. If tests failed, the Code Agent will attempt to fix the code (or the Spec Agent might adjust a scenario if the test itself was wrong). If a static analysis found an issue, the Code Agent or relevant agent addresses it. Refinement can also include **refactoring** for code quality improvements (even if functionally correct, the system might take an extra pass to improve structure or performance). After refinement, the cycle repeats – new tests or requirements might be introduced (expand), evaluation runs again, and so forth. In dialectic, this is the *synthesis* – resolving differences to form a better solution.

This loop continues until a certain condition is met – typically, all defined tests pass (behavior tests and unit tests) and no new requirements are pending. At that point, the feature or user story being worked on can be considered completed, and perhaps the user can introduce the next feature to implement.

**Orchestrator (Supervisor Agent):** We will implement a central orchestrator that manages this graph and makes high-level decisions. In LangGraph, this could be modeled as a special agent node that examines the current state and directs which agent/node to execute next (somewhat like a router). In fact, LangGraph encourages an explicit definition of state and a clear control flow: *“LangGraph requires the explicit definition of the state… a common state schema across different agents”*. We will define a Pydantic model or TypedDict for the shared **state** (containing spec, tests, code pointers, etc.), so that each agent can read/write relevant parts of it. The orchestrator will look at this state (e.g., check `tests_passed` flag or `pending_requirements`) to decide transitions. For instance, the graph could have a loop edge from the Validation outcome back to the Code Generation node if not all tests passed.

In practice, the orchestrator can be implemented by LangGraph’s `StateGraph` and a set of conditional edges. We will define something like: `START -> SpecAgent -> BDDAgent -> CodeAgent -> UnitTestAgent -> ValidationAgent -> (loop back to CodeAgent if tests fail) -> END`. However, since multiple refinements might be needed in different parts (code or even tests), our graph might contain a decision after validation: if failure is in a behavior test expectation, maybe code needs refining; if failure is in a unit test (i.e., a unit test itself might be wrong or too strict), perhaps the test agent gets invoked to review that test. These branching conditions encode the logic a human tech lead might apply when iterating on code and tests.

**Dialetical (Dual-Agent) Interactions:** While one could implement each stage with a single agent, we plan to enhance reliability by sometimes using **pairs of agents in a dialectical role-play**. This draws inspiration from ChatDev’s approach, where for each subtask two agents (an “instructor” and an “assistant”) dialog to reach a solution. In our context, this can be applied in critical generation steps:

* For example, the Code Generation Agent could actually be split into a **Code Writer** and a **Code Reviewer** agent. The Code Writer drafts the code for a feature; then the Code Reviewer (with expertise in best practices and knowledge of the spec) reviews that draft, adds comments or requests changes. They could have a short back-and-forth (simulating a pull-request review process). Once they agree (the writer incorporates the feedback), the orchestrator proceeds. This dialectic ensures a second layer of quality check before code even hits the testing phase.
* Similarly, a dual-agent pattern could be used in Specification generation (a “Product Owner” agent describing requirements and a “Requirements Analyst” agent questioning ambiguities) or in Test generation (one agent writes a test, another tries to poke holes or finds edge cases that were missed, prompting additional scenario generation). These internal debates make the outcome more robust. We will utilize LangGraph’s ability to include subgraphs or parallel nodes for such interactions. (If LangGraph doesn’t natively support parallel dialogue, the agents can be orchestrated sequentially with their outputs feeding into each other in a loop until convergence). The framework will have prompt templates for these roles to encourage constructive critique. This approach leverages **LLM self-reflection and self-correction** techniques from recent research – e.g., the Reflexion framework shows that having agents reflect on feedback and attempt a task again greatly improves success rates. Our design explicitly bakes reflection in via these multi-agent conversations and iterative loops.

**Knowledge and Memory:** The persistent state (in a database and in-memory) acts as the shared memory for all agents. However, LLMs have context length limits, so not all state can be fed into every prompt. We need a strategy for providing relevant context to each agent:

* The **Specification Agent** might need to see the high-level project goal or existing spec to update it.
* The **Test Agents** need to see the user story or spec to know what scenarios to write, and possibly the code (for unit tests targeting specific functions, the agent might inspect function signatures).
* The **Code Agent** definitely needs to see the spec (requirements or acceptance criteria) and the tests it is supposed to make pass. It might also benefit from seeing current code base structure (e.g., a list of modules or relevant code context if modifying an existing part).
* The **Validation Agent** will run tools rather than LLM context, but if using an LLM for reasoning, it might need a summary of test results or static analysis findings.

To manage context, we will implement a **context assembly mechanism** as part of each agent’s invocation. This could be rule-based (e.g., always include the latest spec and the specific test scenario that’s failing for the Code Agent) and possibly retrieval-based. If the project spec becomes very large, we could use a vector store to fetch the most relevant requirement to the current function being implemented. Likewise, long code files might be summarized for the LLM if needed. LangGraph doesn’t impose how memory is stored, but it provides the means to maintain state across calls. We will also follow ChatDev’s idea of segmenting memory – e.g., keep separate short-term memory for the current task (provided in prompt) and long-term memory for the whole project (queried as needed). The embedded database can serve as a long-term memory store. In addition, important global knowledge (like coding standards, security guidelines) can be provided via system prompts or retrieved from a knowledge base when the Critique/Validation agent is doing reasoning.

## Component Agents and Their Roles

We now break down the specialized agents (modules) in the system. Each agent is responsible for a facet of the SDLC. They communicate via the shared state and through outputs that become inputs for others. Below we describe each agent’s function, how it operates (including prompts and tools), and how it contributes to the expand/differentiate/refine loop:

### 1. **Diagram & Model Synthesis Agent (Design Agent)**

**Purpose:** This agent creates visual models and high-level design diagrams to assist understanding and guide development. It essentially serves as a software architect. Early in a project, it might produce context diagrams or architecture overviews. For a complex feature, it could output a UML sequence diagram, class diagram, or data flow diagram illustrating the planned solution approach.

**Operation:** The agent takes as input the current specification or user story and possibly some design constraints (non-functional requirements, preferred architecture style). It then uses the LLM to generate a description of the architecture or design. This description can be turned into a diagram in one of two ways:

* **Textual Diagram Definitions:** The agent can output diagrams in a textual DSL like **Mermaid** or **PlantUML**. For example, it might produce a Mermaid class diagram code block describing classes and relationships. We will leverage the fact that LLMs are quite capable of generating these formats. The agent then calls a *diagram rendering tool* to render an image (so the user can view it easily in the CLI or documentation). The Mermaid CLI or PlantUML jar could be invoked for this.
* **Diagram Libraries:** Alternatively, the agent could use a Python library like `diagrams` (for cloud architecture diagrams) programmatically, but that might require coding. Likely, the textual approach is simpler and more general.

**Output:** The diagram (as file or embedded in documentation) and a structured model description (perhaps a list of components and their roles, extracted from the diagram). This output is stored in the state and possibly referenced by the Specification Agent (to ensure spec and diagram are aligned). The diagram agent may also generate models such as database schema or ER diagrams if that’s relevant. All outputs are subject to human review – e.g., the CLI will show the diagram description and maybe open the image for confirmation.

**Tools & Libraries:** Mermaid/PlantUML as mentioned. Also, the agent might have access to prior art – if a similar design exists, it could retrieve known design patterns. But primarily, it uses the LLM’s knowledge of architecture. It should follow best practices (the prompts can instruct it to use established patterns like MVC, hexagonal architecture, etc., appropriate to the project). Security considerations: if the design involves sensitive data flows, the agent should mark those (for example, highlight that passwords flow from UI to API to DB, so encryption must be considered). This security-awareness can be part of its prompt.

**Iterative Role:** In expand/differentiate/refine terms, the Diagram Agent usually participates in the *expand* phase (producing a new design artifact). But it could also be used in refine – e.g., if later in development the code structure drifts from the original design, one could re-run the agent to update diagrams (expanding documentation) and then possibly differentiate by comparing design vs code (though that comparison might be manual unless we build a tool for it).

### 2. **Specification Generation Agent (Spec Agent)**

**Purpose:** Acts as a **requirements analyst/product manager**. It generates or updates the formal specification for the project or feature at hand. This could be a written Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, user stories, or simply a structured list of acceptance criteria. The spec is the source of truth that all tests and code should ultimately satisfy.

**Operation:** Initially, the user might provide a high-level idea or a one-line requirement. The Spec Agent will expand this into a detailed spec. For example, input: “A to-do list app” -> the agent produces a spec covering user stories like “User can add a new to-do item”, “User can mark an item as done”, etc., and non-functional requirements if any. It can structure the spec in sections (Overview, Functional Requirements, Use Cases, etc.). The agent should follow the **BDD practice of describing behaviors in user-centric terms**. Possibly, it outputs Gherkin-like scenarios within the spec as well (though we have a dedicated BDD agent, the spec could include some scenario outlines).

The agent will maintain the spec over time: when a new feature is to be added, it updates the spec; if a change is made, it ensures the spec is consistent. For versioning, we might store the spec in a markdown or Asciidoc file under version control.

**Output:** A **specification artifact** (could be Markdown, reStructuredText, etc., possibly configurable). This is human-readable and serves as documentation. It might also output a machine-readable summary, e.g. a list of user story IDs or a model of the domain (which could feed into test generation agent). The spec content influences the Behavior Test Agent heavily.

**Integration with BDD:** The spec agent’s output will be used as input for the next agent. For example, if it outputs user stories, the BDD Test Agent will take each story and generate Gherkin scenarios for it. This aligns with known ideas in literature: *“capture user requirements as user stories; refine them with acceptance tests in natural language (Gherkin)… following ATDD/BDD principles”*. Our pipeline automates exactly that: Spec Agent produces stories, BDD Agent produces Gherkin scenarios from those stories, then code is written to make them pass.

**Tools & Libraries:** Mostly just the OpenAI LLM via LangGraph for generation. It may use templates for standard spec sections. We might also integrate something like **OpenAPI** if the project is API-centric – e.g., the agent might decide to produce an OpenAPI spec for an API feature, which can then be used by code generation or test generation tools. Reusing such standard formats would be beneficial (and many libraries can generate skeleton code from an OpenAPI doc). If the project is GUI-heavy, the spec agent might output a simplified UI flow or wireframe description; we won’t aim to generate actual images, but it could describe UI elements.

**Quality Considerations:** The spec agent needs to ensure clarity and unambiguity. It might employ its own mini dialectic: generate spec, then have a “spec reviewer” agent check for unclear language or missing requirements. For example, if a requirement says “system should be fast”, the reviewer might flag that “fast” is vague without a metric. This feedback loop can refine the spec. Ultimately, the human will verify the spec since it’s a critical piece.

### 3. **Behavior Test Generation Agent (BDD Agent)**

**Purpose:** Serves as a **QA or business analyst** focusing on acceptance criteria. It takes the specification (especially user stories/requirements from the Spec Agent) and generates **behavior-driven tests** in Gherkin syntax (or a similar format). This agent ensures we have high-level acceptance tests representing the user’s perspective for each requirement, enabling **Acceptance Test-Driven Development**.

**Operation:** For each user story or feature in the spec, the BDD Agent will produce one or more Gherkin scenarios:

* “**Given** \[some initial context], **When** \[the user performs an action], **Then** \[expected outcome]”. These scenarios should cover the normal case and important edge or error cases. For example, for a login feature: a scenario for correct password and one for incorrect password.
* The agent writes these scenarios in a `.feature` file grouped by feature. It also ensures the language is clear and testable. We can instruct the agent to keep scenario steps at a high level (no UI detail unless relevant, focusing on behavior).

This process is supported by research – LLMs have been shown capable of generating Gherkin scenarios from user story text. In fact, an LLM-powered tool (AutoUAT) in an industrial case study could **“automatically generate acceptance test scenarios in Gherkin from user stories”**, which validates our approach. We will incorporate similar prompts, possibly providing examples: *Given a user story "X", output Gherkin scenarios covering main and edge cases.* We also ensure the agent knows the context of the system (via spec) so it generates realistic steps.

**Output:** One or more Gherkin feature files (or an equivalent BDD test artifact). These are plain text and stored in the project (e.g., `features/` directory if using behave). Additionally, the agent might output a brief rationale for each scenario (to help the human understand why that test exists). This rationale can be included as comments in the feature file.

After generation, these scenarios are presented to the human for review. The user may adjust wording or add/remove scenarios. Once accepted, the next step is to automate them.

**Automation of BDD:** The agent (or a subsequent sub-agent) could also generate **step definitions** code that ties the Gherkin steps to actual code calls. For instance, if the project is Python, for each “Given/When/Then” step, produce a Python function with a decorator like `@given("...")` that calls into the yet-to-be-written application code. Initially, these will likely call placeholder functions or APIs (since the app code might not exist yet). That’s okay – writing these step definitions essentially translates the high-level scenario into concrete calls (this is a form of scaffolding). The step definitions would probably fail if run, until the actual code is generated to implement them. This is part of the **differentiation** step: running these BDD tests will fail, identifying which functionality is missing.

**Tools & Libraries:** Use **Cucumber/Behave** syntax conventions. Possibly call a utility that can parse the feature file to list out undefined steps, which we then stub out. This could even be dynamic: the agent could run `behave --dry-run` to see what step definitions are needed, then create those. Integration with the target language’s testing framework is key:

* Python: Behave or pytest-bdd.
* JavaScript: CucumberJS or Cypress (Cypress actually allows Gherkin via preprocessor, or we could generate Cypress integration tests which follow Given/When/Then structure).
* For simplicity, we might focus on one (say Python/Behave) for initial implementation and ensure the design allows swapping out for another language’s BDD tool via configuration.

**Iterative Use:** In initial cycles, the BDD Agent generates tests for new features (expand phase). In later cycles, it might be invoked in refine phase if, say, a scenario needs updating (perhaps the spec changed or an assumption was wrong). There might also be a mechanism for the Validation Agent to suggest new scenarios if a certain condition isn’t tested (though more often it’s the human who might say “we should also test XYZ”).

### 4. **Unit/Integration Test Generation Agent (Unit Test Agent)**

**Purpose:** Another QA role focusing on **developer tests (TDD)**. While BDD tests cover end-to-end behavior, this agent writes more granular tests (unit tests for functions, integration tests for components). These tests drive the implementation details and ensure internal correctness.

**Operation:** This agent will usually trigger after or in parallel with the Code Generation agent’s work on a particular module. In a true TDD loop, you’d write a unit test *before* writing the function. We can simulate that by having this agent generate some initial failing tests from the spec *before* code is written, but it might be more effective to generate unit tests once at least some code structure is there to test. We can do a bit of both:

* **Pre-implementation TDD:** Based on the spec (and possibly the BDD scenarios), the agent can hypothesize some module-level tests. E.g., spec says “password must be >8 chars”, the agent can write a unit test for `validate_password()` expecting False on 5 chars. If the code doesn’t exist yet, these tests will fail to compile/run until the code is written. This guides the Code agent on what functions and behavior to implement.
* **Post-implementation testing:** After the Code agent writes some code, the Test agent can examine the code (maybe via parsing or reading docstrings) and generate additional tests to cover edge cases the code might have missed. It can also generate **integration tests** to ensure modules work together (for example, test that the controller and database layers interact properly for a given use case, possibly using a lightweight in-memory DB or mocked components).

We will use GPT-4’s capabilities here with careful prompt engineering: e.g. *“Given this code and its purpose, generate unit tests with high coverage, using the X testing framework.”* There has been research where LLMs generated unit tests to improve coverage, and even achieving decent coverage on real codebases. We can also instruct the agent to avoid trivial tests and focus on meaningful ones (the risk with automated test gen is sometimes it produces tautological tests or duplicates logic).

**Output:** Test code files (like `test_module.py` for Python with multiple test\_\* functions, or for Rust maybe a tests mod, etc.). These are added to the project’s tests folder. The output should include both positive and negative cases, aiming for high coverage. If using Python, we might integrate with `coverage.py` – after running tests, the Validation step can report coverage and if it’s below a threshold, that might trigger the Test agent to add more tests (a possible refine loop specific to testing thoroughness).

**Tools & Libraries:** The agent will rely on the language’s testing frameworks:

* Python: pytest is default (simple and widely used). The agent should output pytest-style tests. It might also use hypothesis for property-based tests if prompted.
* Java: JUnit or similar.
* JS: Jest/Mocha, etc.
  We could allow the agent to run a static analysis tool to gather target functions for testing. For instance, if code is written, use `inspect` (in Python) to list public functions of a class, ensure each has at least one test.

**Role in Loop:** These tests are part of the **expand** (they add new tests that will initially fail until code meets them) and also **differentiate** (once code exists, running these tests tells us what’s failing). The Code agent will then refine code to make these tests pass. This interplay realizes the TDD cycle: test -> fail -> code -> pass. The orchestrator ensures that for every new test from this agent, eventually a corresponding code update happens to satisfy it.

### 5. **Code Generation & Refactoring Agent (Code Agent)**

**Purpose:** This is the core **developer/coder** agent. It generates application code to implement the requirements and fix issues, as well as refactoring existing code for improvements. It is likely the most frequently invoked agent, as it responds to the needs identified by tests and specifications.

**Operation:** The Code Agent operates in two modes: **initial generation** and **refinement/refactoring**:

* **Initial Generation (Expand):** When a new feature or test is introduced, this agent is tasked with writing the minimal code to satisfy the requirement. For example, after a BDD scenario and some unit tests are in place, the Code Agent will create the functions, classes, and logic needed so that those tests can pass. It should try to only implement what is necessary (to avoid gold-plating and keep focus on passing tests – classic TDD discipline).
* **Refinement (Fixing Bugs, Optimizing, Refactoring):** When the differentiate phase finds failing tests or issues, the Code Agent updates the code. This could mean fixing a bug causing a test failure, or altering logic to match an updated spec. It also includes refactoring: e.g., after all tests pass, the orchestrator might call the Code Agent in a “refactor” step where it doesn’t add functionality but improves code structure. This agent should ensure the refactored code still passes all tests (so it will likely run tests after refactoring to verify, via a tool or by delegating to Validation agent).

**LLM prompting:** The Code Agent’s prompt will contain:

* Relevant slices of the spec (especially the requirement it’s working on).
* The failing test (if addressing a test failure, show the test code and error message).
* The current code context (e.g., if adding a new function in a file, show the existing file content or at least the signatures of related functions).
* Instructions to *write code only* in the given language, follow style guidelines, etc. The agent should output code, possibly accompanied by a brief explanation or comments in the code explaining the implementation (documentation is a plus).
  We will leverage OpenAI Codex/GPT-4’s strength in code generation. The agent might handle multi-file code (for example, generate a new file and also modify an existing one to register the new component).

**Multi-language support:** Since we want extensibility, this agent will have a base class and multiple implementations or prompt templates per language. E.g., `PythonCodeAgent`, `RustCodeAgent` etc., each with knowledge of project structure for that language (like in Rust, create a new module and mod.rs entry, etc.). The orchestrator would invoke the appropriate one based on project settings. Initially, implementing this for Python (with an eye on how to generalize) is the plan.

**Use of Tools:** The Code Agent can call various developer tools to assist:

* It might use a *compiler or interpreter* to quickly sanity check its output (for compiled languages, run a compile to catch errors; for Python, maybe parse the AST to ensure syntax correctness).
* It should run linters/formatters on the new code (these can be auto-fixes rather than requiring the LLM to perfectly format everything).
* For certain tasks, it could retrieve library usage examples via a search tool (for instance, if it needs to use a specific API, search in documentation).
* If the code generation is large, it might break it into parts (generate class skeleton first, then methods, etc.). LangGraph could help here by splitting tasks or the agent itself could plan internally.

**Output:** New or modified source code files. These changes are applied to an in-memory representation of the project or to a sandbox directory for review. The CLI will show a diff to the user. If accepted, the changes merge into the main project source.

**Quality Assurance:** The Code Agent is guided by tests, but we also add internal checks:

* After the agent writes code, we automatically run the static analyzers. If issues are found (like a security flaw or a style violation), the agent (or a sub-agent) might be triggered to fix them. Alternatively, the Validation agent could catch those and loop back.
* The agent should incorporate docstrings and comments as appropriate (maybe not for every single function, but key ones).
* Use proper error handling, input validation as per spec (if spec says “if user enters invalid data, show error”, ensure code does that).
* **Security:** For example, if it’s writing SQL queries, ensure it uses parameterization to prevent injection. These kinds of domain-specific best practices can be baked into the system prompts or provided as reference to the agent. A future improvement could be integrating something like a **secure coding critic** that reviews the diff and points out potential security issues (similar to CodeQL queries). For now, we rely on LLM’s knowledge and static analysis tools.

**Refactoring mode:** We explicitly allow the orchestrator or user to trigger a refactor. In this mode, no new tests are being added; the agent is instructed to improve code (e.g., “This function is too long, split it” or “There’s duplication, refactor to a helper method”). The LLM can handle this, but we must be cautious to retest after. We could incorporate a rule: run all tests after refactor, and if anything breaks, either revert or have the agent fix it. Because we have the safety net of tests, the agent can be bold in refactoring (tests will catch any functional changes). This addresses technical debt continuously.

### 6. **Validation, Verification & Reasoning Agent (Validation Agent)**

**Purpose:** This agent is the **quality gatekeeper and logical reasoner**. It is responsible for running tests, performing analysis, and doing higher-level reasoning about the project’s correctness and completeness. It essentially asks: *“Are we done, and is everything consistent and robust?”* If not, it identifies what is missing or wrong. This agent plays a key role in the *differentiate* phase of each cycle and also in final verification.

**Operation:** The Validation Agent has a few distinct functions:

* **Run Automated Tests:** It invokes the test suite runners for both BDD scenarios and unit tests. For example, run `behave` for BDD and `pytest` for unit tests (or the equivalents in other languages). It collects the results: which scenarios failed, which unit tests failed, and the error messages/tracebacks. This info is stored in state (and relevant parts will be passed to the Code Agent or Test Agent for fixing). If all tests passed, that’s a major signal that the implementation meets the spec for the scenarios covered.
* **Static Analysis & Linting:** The agent runs linters, type-checkers, security scanners as configured. This might be done sequentially: e.g., first run ESLint or Pylint for style issues, then Bandit or a security linter for vulnerable code patterns, then Mypy for type errors. The results (warnings, errors) are parsed. We may classify them by severity. For any critical findings (e.g., a potential SQL injection warning, or a blatant type error), we will treat it as a failure that needs refinement (like a failing test). Less critical issues (like a styling nit) could either be auto-fixed or queued for a refactor pass.
* **Performance/Complexity Checks:** Optionally, the agent can also analyze code complexity (using tools like radon for cyclomatic complexity in Python, or just by heuristics). If a function is extremely complex or slow (maybe we integrate a profiler in a test scenario), it could flag that for refactoring. These checks might not run every cycle, but could be part of a “verification” stage before declaring completion.
* **Reasoning and Consistency:** This is a more **cognitive** role using the LLM to reflect on the overall state. For instance, after all tests pass, we might have the Validation Agent (in LLM mode) go through the spec and code to see if any requirement might have been overlooked (a kind of double-check). It could also verify that no extraneous functionality was added that isn’t specified (to avoid scope creep). The agent can be prompted with something like: *“Given the specification and the final code (or a summary), are there any requirements not covered by tests or code? Are all business rules enforced? List any potential gaps or suggest additional tests if any.”* The LLM might then produce insights (e.g., “Spec mentions password reset feature, but I don’t see implementation for that – maybe it’s incomplete”). Such reasoning acts as a safety net for spec-coverage. If it identifies a gap, that actually leads to a new cycle: we’d then generate tests and code for that missing part.
* **Final Verification:** When the user believes the feature is done, this agent does a last run of everything and can generate a **verification report**. This report would summarize: all tests passing, coverage X%, no critical linter issues, performance N/A (or meets criteria), etc. The report can be stored or presented to the user as evidence. If this is part of a CI/CD pipeline, that report could be used to approve a merge.

**Output:** Mainly, the outcomes of tests and analyses. The agent doesn’t produce product code, but rather logs, reports, and possibly reasoning text. It updates the shared state with flags like `tests_passed=True` or lists of failures. It may also output suggestions or new tickets (for anything it finds that is out of current scope – e.g., “Add encryption for user data as an enhancement”). Those could be logged for the user rather than automatically acted on.

**Tools & Libraries:**

* Testing frameworks (mentioned earlier).
* Linters: Flake8/Pylint, ESLint, Clippy for Rust, etc.
* Security: Bandit (Python), npm audit (JS), cargo audit (Rust) for dependencies.
* Performance: Could use simple timing of tests or static checks.
* Memory/State: to do cross-checks, it might query the spec and code. Perhaps use a lightweight parser or AST to see if certain functions exist corresponding to requirements (for example, if spec says “The system shall send an email”, verify that code calls an email API somewhere).
* **LLM Reasoning:** The agent will use OpenAI models for the reasoning part. This might be invoked only when things are green (to avoid the LLM pointing out issues that are already found by concrete tests). Or it could be used when tests are failing to provide hints (“It looks like many tests are failing around input validation, maybe the code is not handling those properly”).

**Agent Reasoning and Advanced Techniques:** This agent is a good place to implement advanced patterns like **self-reflection** and chain-of-thought. For instance, if a test fails, we could have the Validation Agent ask (via LLM): “Why did this test fail? What does that imply needs to be changed?” – effectively doing a preliminary diagnosis. This could guide the Code Agent’s next action more directly. In complex scenarios, multi-step reasoning (Tree of Thoughts, etc.) might be employed by this agent to figure out a plan (like if multiple issues arise at once, decide an order to fix them). These are optional enhancements – at minimum, capturing the failures and passing them along might suffice, but adding reasoning can make the AI more autonomous by reducing back-and-forth with the human for figuring out obvious fixes.

**Human-in-the-loop:** If the Validation agent finds issues that are non-trivial, it can surface them to the user along with possible solutions. For example, “Test X failed due to Y. I can attempt to fix this by doing Z. Would you like me to proceed?” The user can then confirm or intervene. This ties back to the user-friendly CLI: presenting analysis in an understandable way. (LLM can help translate a raw stack trace into a user-friendly explanation.)

**Continuous Integration:** It’s worth noting that this agent’s functionality aligns with what a CI pipeline does (running tests, linters). One could integrate this with real CI/CD: e.g., allow the agent to open a PR and have a GitHub Actions run of tests feed results back in. Initially, we’ll run locally, but the design could later integrate external CI for large projects.

## Workflow Execution Example

To illustrate how these agents work together in a cycle, consider a simple user story: *“As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access if I forget it.”* Here’s how a typical expand-differentiate-refine loop would play out:

1. **Expand (Specification):** The user provides the above story. The **Spec Agent** expands it into detailed requirements: e.g., *“The system shall allow a user to request a password reset link via their email. Upon clicking the link, the user can set a new password. The link expires after 1 hour.”* This spec is saved and shown to the user for approval.

2. **Expand (Behavior Tests):** The orchestrator triggers the **BDD Agent** with that new spec. It generates Gherkin scenarios like:

   * *Scenario: Reset password successfully (Given user has an account, When they request reset, Then an email is sent, etc.)*
   * *Scenario: Reset link expired (Given link is older than 1 hour, Then it is rejected)*, etc.
     These scenarios are output in `password_reset.feature`. User reviews and accepts them.

3. **Differentiate (Initial Test Run):** The **Validation Agent** runs `behave` on these scenarios. Naturally, all scenarios fail because no code exists. The failures (likely steps undefined or assertions failing) are recorded. This indicates we need to generate code. It could also run unit tests, but we have none yet, so skip.

4. **Expand (Code generation):** The **Code Agent** is invoked to implement just enough to make progress on those BDD scenarios. It might create:

   * A new `PasswordResetService` class with a method `request_reset(email)` and `confirm_reset(token, new_password)`. Initially, maybe it just stores a token somewhere and prints a message (to satisfy the scenario steps minimally).
   * It also might produce a stub for sending email (maybe just a log, unless an email service is in scope).
     The idea is to get a basic flow that might satisfy a very optimistic path of the test. The code is generated and presented as diff to user. User approves adding these files.

5. **Expand (Unit Tests):** Now the **Unit Test Agent** inspects the new code (or the spec) and writes some unit tests, for example:

   * Test that `request_reset("user@example.com")` returns a token and that token is valid format.
   * Test that `confirm_reset(token, newpass)` actually changes the user’s password (here the agent might realize we need a User model or stub – possibly noticing a gap).
     These tests go into `test_password_reset.py`. They will likely fail initially (especially if certain pieces like a User model aren’t implemented).

6. **Differentiate (Run tests):** Validation Agent runs `pytest` now. It fails, say because `PasswordResetService` is using a User model that doesn’t exist (NameError) or the confirm\_reset doesn’t actually do anything. Also, BDD tests might still be failing because maybe the step “Then I receive an email” is not actually causing an email send (we only logged it). The agent gathers these failure details.

7. **Refine (Code fixes):** The Code Agent comes back to fix these issues:

   * Realizes a User model or repository is needed: creates a simple `User` class or uses an existing user module to add a method to update password.
   * Implements an `EmailService.send_reset_email(email, token)` (could be just a stub that sets a flag, unless emailing is in scope).
   * Ensures that after `confirm_reset`, a flag is set or password is changed.
   * Also, it might adjust the BDD step definitions if needed (for instance, to simulate clicking the email link by directly calling confirm).
     After fixes, it outputs diffs (new or modified files). User reviews, maybe slight adjustments, and approves.

8. **Differentiate (Re-run tests):** Validation Agent runs tests again:

   * Unit tests: maybe now pass for valid cases, but perhaps we didn’t handle the expired token yet, so if there’s a test for that, it fails.
   * BDD: possibly now one scenario passes (the happy path) but the expired link scenario still fails (if we haven’t implemented token expiration).
     The agent notes: failing scenario “expired link”.

9. **Refine (Add missing feature per test):** This likely triggers a new Expand/Code step: implement token expiry check. The Code Agent adds code to store timestamp for token and reject if too old. Also adds tests for this if not already (or Test Agent can add one).
   Code diff is reviewed and accepted.

10. **Differentiate (Run all tests):** Now suppose all BDD and unit tests pass. Coverage is say 90%. Linters run – maybe some minor style issues fixed automatically or flagged for later. The Validation Agent now does the reasoning pass: it checks spec vs tests. It sees that everything in the spec is covered by scenarios. It might suggest, “We should also test if an invalid email is given” – if that was not in spec. If user agrees, that’s a new scenario to add (we loop back with BDD agent to add it). Let’s say spec was thorough, so no further suggestions.

11. **Expand (Documentation & Diagram):** Possibly, now that implementation is done, the orchestrator calls the Diagram Agent to update any diagrams (maybe a sequence diagram of password reset flow). It outputs that and it matches our code.

12. **Finalize:** The human user is satisfied, all tests are green. The orchestrator moves to an END state for this feature. It might tag the state as “Feature complete”. The CLI prints a summary: “Feature X implemented with Y tests passing. Ready for deployment.”

Throughout this, the **embedded state** recorded each step. We have logs of each agent’s actions (which could be reviewed or replayed). If at any point the user didn’t like a decision (say the way code agent implemented emailing), they could have edited the spec or given a direct instruction (“use SMTP for real email”) and re-run that part.

This example demonstrates how the framework orchestrates multiple agents in a coherent workflow to gradually build and verify a software feature.

## CLI Design and User Interaction

A key aspect is presenting this complex orchestration in a **user-friendly CLI interface** that experienced developers find natural and helpful. Below are design considerations and features of the CLI:

* **Command Structure:** Use a top-level command (let’s call it `ai-sdlc` for now) with subcommands for common tasks:

  * `ai-sdlc init` – initialize a new project (sets up directory, perhaps asks for base language, creates a config file, etc., and maybe triggers Spec agent if an initial idea is provided).
  * `ai-sdlc add feature "description"` – start the process for a new feature/user story. This could combine several steps: feed description to Spec Agent and BDD Agent, producing initial spec and tests.
  * `ai-sdlc run` – run the main loop to implement pending features or until no failing tests. This effectively kicks off orchestrator cycles.
  * `ai-sdlc test` – manually trigger the Validation agent (run all tests and report).
  * `ai-sdlc refine` – manually trigger a refactoring/improvement pass (Code agent).
  * `ai-sdlc status` – show current state (which features are done, how many tests pass, etc.).
  * Possibly `ai-sdlc agents` – to list or manage agents (like toggle which ones active, though normally fixed).

  Alternatively, an **interactive mode** can be offered: just run `ai-sdlc` and it drops into a REPL or guided session. In that mode, the tool could prompt the user step by step, or accept typed commands like an interactive prompt (like how `git` or `gdb` have interactive usage).

* **Rich Text Feedback:** The CLI should clearly delineate different types of output:

  * **Agent Prompts & Replies (Optional):** We might show a summarized conversation of agents for transparency, but by default we might hide raw LLM prompts to avoid clutter. Instead, we show results. However, advanced users might toggle a “verbose” mode to see the full reasoning dialogue or the content of prompts if debugging why the AI did something.
  * **Diffs:** When code changes are proposed, show a unified diff. Possibly use color coding: green for additions, red for deletions, etc. We can use `difflib` or `git diff` style output. Ideally, only the relevant context is shown.
  * **Test results:** If tests fail, present a summary: e.g., “2 scenarios failed, 3 unit tests failed.” Then for each failure, show a short message or the failing assertion. For example: “Scenario 'Reset link expired' FAILED at step 'Then I should see an error' – Expected error not shown.” or a unit test failure with traceback highlighting actual vs expected. Use indentation or bullet points to list them. This should be easily scannable.
  * **Logging and State Changes:** When an agent completes, print a message. e.g., “\[SpecAgent] Updated Specification with 1 new requirement.”, “\[CodeAgent] Generated module `password_reset.py`.” These provide a high-level trace of what’s happening.
  * **User Prompts:** Whenever user approval is needed, the CLI should prompt clearly. For example, after showing a diff:

    ```
    Apply this change? (Y/n/view diff in editor) 
    ```

    The user can accept or decline. If declined, perhaps ask if they want to modify anything or regenerate.
  * Possibly allow dropping into an editor: e.g., if the user wants to manually edit the spec or code at some point, the CLI could open `$EDITOR` on the file, then resume.

* **Configuration & Project Context:** The CLI will read a config (like a `pyproject.toml` or a custom yaml in the project) which specifies things like target language(s), test frameworks, maybe OpenAI API keys, etc. On init, we gather these. We also allow environment variables for secrets (OpenAI key, etc.) rather than storing them in project.

* **Persistence Integration:** The CLI commands will utilize the persistent state DB. For instance, `status` reads from DB how many cycles run, which tests exist, etc. If the process was interrupted, running `ai-sdlc run` again will continue where left off (thanks to state). This is important for long sessions or if the user wants to exit and come back later.

* **Parallel vs Sequential Execution:** Initially, we likely run agents sequentially due to single-threaded constraints (and easier reasoning). In the future, some steps could be parallelized (like running linters and tests in parallel in the Validation stage). But the CLI should manage a queue or use async to possibly run independent checks together for speed. However, the output should still be logically ordered (don’t mix lines).

* **Error Handling and Recovery:** If an agent fails (e.g., OpenAI API error or it produces invalid output), the CLI should catch exceptions and present a friendly error. Possibly allow retry. The framework could include a retry mechanism for the LLM calls or switch to a backup model if one fails. If a tool call fails (like the test runner crashes), that output is logged and shown, and the CLI may offer to continue or stop.

* **Observability for users:** Perhaps include a command `ai-sdlc log` to dump the latest actions or open an interface to browse historical runs. This ties into our persistent logging – enabling the user to review what happened in past sessions.

* **Help and Documentation:** Like any good CLI, `ai-sdlc --help` should list subcommands and usage. Given our audience (experienced devs), we assume familiarity with CLI tools, but clear help is still needed.

In summary, the CLI acts as the **front-end** for our orchestration engine, translating the behind-the-scenes agent interactions into a developer-friendly workflow, akin to a very smart pair programmer that communicates through the terminal. The user should feel in control, informed, but also significantly accelerated by what the CLI provides (automated writing and checking).

## Security and Quality Assurance Practices

Security and code quality have been threaded through the design above; here we summarize concrete measures and best practices the framework will enforce:

* **Secure Development Lifecycle Integration:** The framework doesn’t just generate code; it will integrate aspects of a Secure DLC. For example, the Validation Agent running security linters is one. We can also include a library of **security requirements** (like OWASP Top 10) and have the Spec Agent or Validation agent cross-check if they’re relevant. If the project is a web app, ensure there's a requirement for input validation and output encoding (prevent XSS, etc.), and tests for the same. The presence of these from the get-go means the Code agent will implement them, resulting in more secure code. Essentially, we want the AI to **bake in security from the design phase onward**, not as an afterthought.

* **Permission Model for Tools:** Agents with powerful tools (like executing code) could pose risks if misused (the code could be harmful). We implement a permission model where by default, certain actions require user confirmation. For instance, the first time the Code Agent wants to run the application or a migration script, prompt the user. Or restrict filesystem access to the project directory only (no arbitrary file writes elsewhere). The CLI can run each tool in a constrained environment (perhaps using a temporary working directory or container for execution). This prevents an LLM going off-script and, say, deleting files or making network calls unless explicitly allowed by the user or design.

* **Isolation of AI Outputs:** Generated code and content will be treated with skepticism until validated. For example, we won’t deploy anything the AI wrote without passing through tests and user review. Also, the tool will watermark or comment sections that are AI-generated in documentation or code comments, if appropriate, so future maintainers know what was human vs AI (this can help in auditing or if an AI introduced something weird).

* **Quality Gates:** We define certain gates that must be passed:

  * **All tests green** is an obvious one.
  * **Coverage threshold**: e.g., at least 80% code coverage (configurable).
  * **No linter errors**: style issues auto-fixed, but no serious ones remain.
  * **No high-severity security findings**: e.g., Bandit found no high-risk usage.
  * Possibly **performance checks**: e.g., if any test scenario is known to be performance heavy (like handling 1000 items), ensure it runs within some time. We could have the LLM generate a performance test scenario and measure it.

  Only when gates are clear does the Validation Agent give the green light. This ensures quality is systematically enforced.

* **Use of Proven Libraries:** We reiterate that whenever possible, the AI should not reinvent the wheel. If a feature can be implemented by using a well-known library, the Code Agent should do so. For instance, for sending emails, use a library like `smtplib` or a third-party lib, rather than coding SMTP from scratch (and potentially introducing bugs). We will maintain a knowledge base (in prompts or external) of recommended libraries for common tasks in each language. This not only improves quality (those libs are tested) but speed (less code to write). The dependency management (Poetry for Python) will handle adding these libs. The agent can edit the pyproject.toml to add a dependency, and then the CLI can run `poetry install` as needed (via a tool call).

* **Continuous Learning and Improvement:** Over time, as users use the framework, we can gather data (with user permission) on where the AI made mistakes or required a lot of corrections. Using that, we can refine prompts or add rules. While this is more of a project management note, it’s part of ensuring quality improves. Potentially, allow plugins for different domains (e.g., a “secure coding plugin” that adds extra checks, or a “performance critical plugin” that applies more rigorous optimization steps).

In essence, the framework operates with a “**trust but verify**” philosophy: trust the AI agents to do the heavy lifting, but verify every important outcome through tests, analysis, and human oversight. By following BDD/TDD, most functional aspects are verified. By incorporating linters and scans, non-functional aspects are covered. And by involving the human, we catch any nuance the automated processes might miss.

## State Persistence and Observability

We have emphasized the need for persistent state; here we detail how it’s structured and how observability is built-in:

* **Embedded Database (State Store):** We will use SQLite (via an ORM or direct SQL) to store key entities:

  * **Requirements** table: each requirement or user story with an ID, description, status (pending, implemented, verified).
  * **Scenarios/Tests** table: each BDD scenario (linked to requirement) with text, and a flag pass/fail from last run. Similarly, unit tests (maybe just store test names or a coverage summary rather than every test).
  * **Code Artifacts** table: could store a listing of files/modules, possibly with a blob of content or a pointer to filesystem. Storing full code in DB may be unnecessary since it’s on disk under version control, but storing hash or version info can be useful.
  * **Agents Log** table: records every invocation of an agent with timestamp, agent name, action summary (e.g., "generated 3 scenarios", "tests passed"). If needed, store the prompt and response (could be large, but maybe store partial or reference to a log file for full detail).
  * **Decisions/State** table: this might have a single row because state is a graph of Python objects at runtime, but we can serialize some global state, like current cycle number, last agent run, etc., for recovery.

  Using SQLite ensures we don’t need a separate server and the data is easily accessible. Alternatively, a simpler JSON or YAML state file could be used, but SQLite is more robust for queries and atomic updates.

* **Logging:** We will implement Python logging throughout the orchestrator. Key events (agent start/finish, errors) are logged to console (at info level) and to a log file (with more detail possibly at debug level). The user can configure log level. The logs combined with the DB give a full picture. The CLI might offer `ai-sdlc log --last-failure` to show the log around the last failure, etc., by querying DB and reading file.

* **Telemetry & Metrics:** For observability beyond logging, we can expose metrics like:

  * Number of cycles run, total tokens used (cost estimate), number of tests generated, etc. These can be output at end or on demand.
  * We might integrate with OpenTelemetry to emit traces for each agent execution, which advanced users could hook to their monitoring (though this is probably overkill for a CLI dev tool in initial version).

* **Visualization:** One cool feature could be to visualize the agent graph and progress. Since LangGraph is inherently a graph, we can output a Graphviz or Mermaid diagram of the workflow, with maybe coloring to indicate which nodes have been completed in the current run. For example, a DAG where nodes turn green as they succeed. The CLI could generate this and either display it as ASCII or open a browser to show a nicer view. However, for MVP, textual status might suffice (like listing completed phases).

* **Debugging Support:** If something goes wrong in the agent’s logic (like it’s stuck in a loop or not producing good output), having the state and logs makes debugging possible. The developer can intervene, and we also aim to provide hints. The system could detect if it’s looping too many times (like 5 iterations with no new tests passing) and warn the user or break out with a suggestion to revise the requirement or provide guidance.

* **Resuming and Collaboration:** With persistent state, even if the program exits, you can restart and pick up. This also opens the door for collaboration where multiple human users or sessions work on the same project state (though concurrency would be tricky). But one could imagine two developers alternating in guiding the AI. In any case, the single source of truth is the project files + state DB which are kept in sync.

* **Securing State:** The state DB might contain sensitive info (like descriptions of code or maybe API keys if spec includes them). We should ensure it's not accessible outside the project or is at least gitignored if not meant to be committed. If users want to commit the spec and tests, that’s fine, but maybe not the raw logs of LLM conversations (could be sensitive or just too verbose). We might separate “artifact outputs” (which are committed) from “operational logs” (not committed).

* **LangGraph and LangSmith Integration:** LangGraph itself might provide some introspection. We could hook into LangGraph’s callbacks to log every node transition in the DB. LangSmith (LangChain’s observability platform) could be integrated to get a richer UI for the agent workflow: it can record prompts, LLM responses, tool uses in a trace. If we choose, we could allow an option to send data to LangSmith so that in their web UI one can inspect what the agents did (this would require an API key and might send code to a third party, so caution). For local, our logging is enough.

The end result is that the framework not only does the job but keeps a **detailed journal** of the software being built. This is extremely useful for compliance or reviews – for example, for safety-critical software one needs to show traceability from requirement to test to code. Our system practically automates the trace links (requirement ID X -> tested by scenario Y -> code commit Z that implemented it, all in the DB). This traceability is a big advantage of an AI-driven but systematically logged process.

## Extensibility for Multiple Languages and Tools

Although Python is the initial focus, the architecture is built to accommodate other programming ecosystems. Here’s how we design for extensibility:

* **Abstract Agent Interfaces:** Define abstract base classes or protocols for each type of agent, with methods like `generate_spec(requirement) -> Spec` or `generate_code(inputs) -> CodeChange`. Implementation of these can vary by language. We will factor out language-specific logic into separate modules. For example, a `BaseCodeAgent` class with a `write_code()` method, and then `PythonCodeAgent` overrides it, as could `RustCodeAgent`. The orchestrator can select which class to instantiate based on config (perhaps by entrypoints or a plugin system).

* **Language Modules:** A language module would include:

  * Prompt templates specific to that language (for code generation, test generation). For instance, the prompt for writing Python code might include “use Python 3.11 and best practices like f-strings”, whereas for C++ it might say “provide C++17 code with appropriate header includes”.
  * Toolchain integration: test runner commands, compiler invocation, formatting tools, etc., for that language. E.g., for Rust, instead of `pytest` you’d use `cargo test`, instead of flake8 you’d use Clippy, etc. The Validation Agent or separate classes would handle these differences.
  * File organization rules: e.g., in Python, one might put code in `.py` files with a certain structure, in Java you need to create specific directory structures for packages. The framework should either ask the user for an initial template project or generate a minimal one. For each language, we can have a project template (like Cookiecutter templates). For Python, maybe a simple Poetry project with `src/` and `tests/`. For a new language, a similar template or guidelines (like a Cargo.toml for Rust, etc.). This ensures the AI has a scaffold to work within and the test execution knows where to run.

* **File Type Extensions:** Beyond programming languages, supporting Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, etc., means having agents or sub-agents that handle those formats:

  * Possibly treat these as special “code” with their own tiny pipeline. E.g., a Dockerfile generation might come from a Deployment Agent that reads the architecture and produces a Dockerfile, and we might test it by building the image (via a tool) to ensure it’s valid.
  * Kubernetes YAML could be generated from a high-level deployment spec (maybe from the Spec agent if it knows deployment requirements). Validating those could involve using `kubectl --dry-run` or schemas. We should incorporate such tools to verify the syntax and maybe even test deploying to a kind cluster if in scope.
  * Shell scripts might be tested by static analyzers (shellcheck) and by running in a safe env.

  We can integrate these as needed. The key is to have modular handling: e.g., a step in the pipeline for “Deployment artifacts” that is conditional (only if project requires it).

* **Library of Agents:** As the open-source community builds more specialized agents (e.g., an agent that can optimize a piece of code for performance, or one that can translate code from one language to another), our framework could let advanced users plug those in. The design should allow adding additional nodes in the workflow or replacing ones. For instance, one might swap out the Code Agent with a different implementation that uses a local model or uses a different strategy (maybe using genetic algorithms to generate code, who knows). Our orchestrator should be flexible in that sense – possibly through a config or plugin interface.

* **APIs and Integration:** While CLI is primary, consider designing an internal API such that the core engine could be invoked from other tools. For example, an IDE plugin might use this under the hood to offer a UI. Or one might incorporate this into a CI system to auto-generate some tests on pull requests. If we have a clean separation of CLI front-end and engine logic, those become possible.

* **Documentation and Samples:** To encourage extension, we’ll document how to add a new language. e.g., “To add support for Go: implement SpecAgent that knows how to format requirements maybe into GoDoc or comments, TestAgent that writes Go tests (probably using `go test`), CodeAgent that uses GPT-4 with knowledge of Go idioms, and update the orchestrator config to include these when language=Go.” If we abstract enough, perhaps much of the orchestrator logic remains same and just agents differ.

* **Testing Extensibility:** We should validate the design by at least prototyping a second language after Python. TypeScript might be a good candidate (similar enough in concept, and OpenAI models are decent at JS). We ensure our design handles multiple file extensions concurrently (for example, in a single project, you might have mostly Python code but also a Dockerfile and maybe some front-end HTML – so multi-type in one project). The orchestrator can orchestrate those sequentially or in parallel (generate backend code, then generate Dockerfile).

* **Limitations:** Not all languages have equally powerful AI model support (some have less data). We might find the LLM struggles more with, say, complex C++ or assembly. In such cases, more reliance on templating and existing code might be needed. But the framework itself remains the same – just the AI might not fully automate it. We assume focusing on high-level languages for now.

In summary, the architecture is made modular so it can **grow** into a truly polyglot AI assistant. By isolating language-specific details and using configuration-driven pipelines, we avoid hard-coding Python-only logic. The use of an established orchestrator (LangGraph) supports this because it’s not tied to any domain; we just plug in different agents.

## Gaps in Current Tools and Proposed Solutions

Our approach touches on many areas (orchestration, multi-agent reasoning, dev tooling) where existing open-source solutions provide pieces but not the whole. We identify some **gaps** and how our framework addresses them or what new development is needed:

1. **End-to-End Orchestration for SDLC:** While frameworks like LangChain/LangGraph allow building agent workflows, there isn’t an out-of-the-box open source solution specifically for orchestrating the entire SDLC with dialectical agents. Projects like ChatDev and MetaGPT come close conceptually, but they are more research demos or limited to specific role-play scenarios. **Gap:** lack of a production-ready, developer-focused orchestration that integrates with real dev tools and supports iterative development with human oversight.
   **Proposed Solution:** Our framework is filling this gap by combining LangGraph’s robust orchestration with domain-specific logic for software engineering. We also emphasize a CLI interface, which many academic projects lack. If LangGraph itself lacks certain features (for example, easy pause/resume or dynamic graph modification), we might contribute to it or build a thin layer on top. We will likely need to implement the specific state management and condition logic (LangGraph gives the building blocks, but we have to craft the graph for our use case).

2. **Visualization and Debugging of Agent Flows:** There are some tools for tracing multi-agent systems (LangSmith traces, or the “Visualizer” in ChatDev’s repo), but these are not general or require running in a browser. **Gap:** a simple way to see what the multi-agent system is doing, step by step, and perhaps to edit or intervene at a granular level.
   **Solution:** We propose a CLI-based visualization (logging with clear stages) and optionally outputting a graph or timeline. If demand arises, we can build a small TUI (text user interface) that updates as agents progress, showing state (like curses-based UI). Another idea is to output a Markdown or HTML report at the end that shows the spec, the scenarios, and how they map to code, which is a form of documentation that also serves as visualization of the whole process. For debugging, we’ll allow a verbose mode to output prompts. We might also integrate an interactive debug mode: e.g., if an agent is not giving the desired output, the user can drop into that step and either modify the prompt or manually do it themselves and then continue. This flexibility is something current pipelines don’t easily allow (they often treat the LLM as a black box). By exposing internals in a controlled way, we empower the developer to troubleshoot.

3. **Agent Reasoning and Reliability:** A known issue with autonomous agents (AutoGPT, BabyAGI, etc.) is they can go off track, hallucinate tasks, or get stuck in loops. LangGraph’s structured approach mitigates some of this by design (there’s a set graph, not infinite freedom), but within each agent call, the LLM could still produce incorrect or suboptimal results. **Gap:** robust reasoning and self-correction within the development context.
   **Solution:** We incorporate *dialectical agents* and *self-reflection* mechanisms. By having agents double-check each other’s work (as with the dual role code reviewer), we catch many mistakes early. Also, by using actual execution (running tests, etc.), we ground the agent’s progress in reality (no matter what the LLM “thinks”, the tests are an objective measure). For planning and avoiding loops, our orchestrator will include safeguards: e.g., a max number of iterations on a given test failure before asking the human for guidance (to avoid infinite fix attempts if requirement is impossible or test is wrong). We may use heuristics to detect non-progress (like if in two iterations, no new tests passed and code changes are minimal, the AI might be stuck). At that point, escalate to user: “I’m having trouble resolving this – perhaps the requirement is ambiguous or conflicting. Please advise.”
   Additionally, leveraging advanced prompting strategies is key. For instance, instructing the Code Agent to *think step by step* about how to fulfill the spec before writing code can help (Chain-of-Thought prompting). Or using the Validation Agent to generate a brief plan for the Code Agent (“here’s what needs to be done to fix tests X, Y, Z”) so the Code Agent doesn’t hallucinate the plan incorrectly. These are relatively new techniques, but our framework can serve as a platform to experiment with them in a practical setting. We might integrate algorithms from papers (like Reflexion, which had the agent write down errors and lessons and try again) – an example: if a test fails, have the agent record a reflection like “I didn’t handle the case of expired token” and store that. Next cycle, feed that reflection in so it doesn’t repeat the mistake. This addresses the gap of “LLM forgets errors after they scroll out of context” by explicitly keeping memory of failures.

4. **Integration with Existing Developer Workflow:** Many AI coding tools (Copilot, etc.) are editor plugins or services, not CLI orchestration. There is a gap in integrating such orchestration with standard dev tools. For instance, how to integrate with version control, or how to let a developer partially use the AI (maybe they want to write some code themselves and have AI do the rest).
   **Solution:** Ensure our CLI plays nicely with Git (e.g., we could auto-create a branch for AI changes). We also allow partial use: developers can skip an agent if they prefer to do that part manually. For example, if they want to write the code themselves but still use the AI for tests and analysis, they can disable the Code Agent and the system will then just verify their code and perhaps suggest improvements. So modular use is possible. This is a selling point to experienced devs: you remain in control, using AI where you see fit.
   Another integration point: Editors/IDE. While not required in spec, we foresee maybe exposing hooks or a language server so that an IDE could display AI suggestions or run the orchestration on command. That could be a future extension.

5. **Lack of Knowledge Sharing between agents:** One challenge is ensuring all agents have a coherent understanding of the project (since each agent call is a separate LLM invocation). We addressed this via state and context assembly. But an open issue is how to transfer “learning” from one problem to another – e.g., the Code Agent might have learned a style or trick that the Test Agent could also benefit from. Right now, frameworks don’t easily share “insights” except via the state we explicitly pass.
   **Solution:** We may implement a mechanism where after each major cycle, we update a **project summary** (an artifact in state) that captures key decisions, design patterns used, etc. This summary can be fed into subsequent prompts to give context. For example, after a few features, we have a summary: “The project is a Flask web app with SQLAlchemy database. We use JWT for auth. Keep that in mind.” This can prevent an agent from suggesting something inconsistent later. We can generate this summary automatically or maintain it in spec. This is somewhat analogous to long-term memory beyond immediate context. If needed, a vector database for semantic search can be integrated (store all previous outputs, and query relevant ones per prompt). If we find context limits hamper progress, we will employ retrieval augmentation (as suggested by LangGraph’s support for RAG). This way we alleviate the gap of context fragmentation.

6. **Evaluation of the AI’s performance:** In open source, there isn’t a standard way to evaluate multi-agent coding systems (everyone shows demos but hard metrics are few). We want to ensure our system actually improves productivity and code quality.
   **Solution:** We can incorporate an *evaluation mode* (maybe using OpenAI’s evals or simply measuring outcomes like number of iterations, lines of code, bugs found). By collecting anonymized metrics from usage, or by running the system on some benchmark tasks (like building known example projects), we identify where it falls short. This continuous evaluation will guide improvements. It’s not a direct user feature, but important for the project’s success.

In summary, while we leverage what exists (LangGraph for orchestration, LLMs for generation, testing tools, etc.), our framework addresses the **integrative gap**: putting it all together in a cohesive developer tool. We plan to contribute back any generic improvements (like if we develop a nice LangGraph visualization, we can contribute it to LangGraph project). The open-source community around multi-agent dev is nascent; our project could become a reference implementation that others extend or learn from. It directly tackles the unmet need for a *practical, AI-driven SDLC tool* rather than just a proof-of-concept.

## Implementation Plan and Roadmap

Building this framework is an ambitious effort. We outline a phased implementation plan with actionable steps for each phase, ensuring we can deliver incremental value and test each part thoroughly:

**Phase 1: Core Orchestration & Skeleton**

* Set up the project repository with a baseline structure (using Python 3.11 and Poetry for dependency management). Include LangGraph as a dependency (assuming it’s pip-installable) and OpenAI API client.
* Implement the basic CLI using a library like Click or Typer for structure. Commands: `init`, `run`, etc. At first, `run` might just print “not implemented” placeholders.
* Define the data model for shared state (e.g., a Pydantic class) and initialize an embedded SQLite DB. Test that we can read/write a simple object (like a dummy requirement) to the DB.
* Construct a minimal LangGraph workflow: Perhaps just two nodes to start – one agent that echoes user input and another that ends – to verify we can integrate LangGraph execution with our CLI command. This is to ensure the plumbing (LangGraph’s graph, our state) works.
* Milestone: Have a CLI that can accept a user story and store it, even if it does nothing with it. This sets the stage for adding real agents.

**Phase 2: Specification & BDD Agents (Planning Phase)**

* Implement the **Spec Agent** to transform a one-line idea into a structured spec. Start with a simple approach (maybe just echo the input as a requirement in a list, to test the flow). Then refine to use OpenAI to generate multiple requirements or an outline. Emphasize one use case first.
* Implement the **BDD Test Agent** to generate Gherkin scenarios from a given requirement. Hard-code a prompt and use GPT-4 to get a sample output. Parse the output to ensure it’s valid Gherkin (we can use a Gherkin parser to validate format).
* Integrate these in the LangGraph workflow: e.g., `UserInput -> SpecAgent -> BDDAgent -> END` for now. Run `ai-sdlc run` and see if it produces a spec and scenarios.
* Develop the CLI to display the spec and scenarios nicely, and prompt user to approve them.
* Write unit tests (for our framework’s code) to verify that given a certain input, the spec agent produces expected kind of output (this may involve mocking OpenAI or using a test double).
* Milestone: User can input a feature description and receive a draft specification and acceptance tests in output, which they can confirm. No code generation yet, but we’ve covered expand steps.

**Phase 3: Code Generation & Unit Test Agents (Development Phase)**

* Implement the **Code Agent** for Python. Start small: maybe have it generate a single function given a very simple spec and test. We can use OpenAI with a prompt template. For initial testing, use a trivial example (like spec: “add two numbers”, test: when adding 2 and 3 expect 5) to see if Code Agent can produce correct code. This avoids complex logic at first.
* Implement the **Unit Test Agent**. Perhaps initially it could just generate one or two basic tests from a function signature or spec.
* Expand the LangGraph workflow: After BDDAgent, add CodeAgent and UnitTestAgent nodes, then a ValidationAgent placeholder. Actually, at this stage, hook up a basic Validation step: run pytest and behave on the generated code/tests.
* Likely, the first integration of all these will be rough – the LLM might not produce correct code or tests on first try. Focus on making the pipeline run through: even if tests fail, ensure the loop can catch that and ideally attempt a fix. Possibly implement a simple loop: if tests fail, just call CodeAgent again once.
* This is a good time to implement diff viewing and applying changes. Instead of directly writing files, have CodeAgent output a diff or a dict of filename->content. Use that to patch an in-memory structure or temp files. Present diff to user in CLI. For auto-apply (maybe if user sets an option), just save it.
* Milestone: Achieve a full cycle for a *very simple* scenario: e.g., user story “add two numbers” -> spec (maybe trivial) -> BDD scenario (Given two numbers 2 and 3, When add, Then result 5) -> Code (function add) -> Unit test (maybe also tests a negative) -> run tests -> pass. This proves the pipeline works end-to-end for a trivial case. From here, we build complexity.

**Phase 4: Validation Agent & Refine Loop (Testing Phase)**

* Flesh out the **Validation Agent** fully. Make it run behave and pytest (or appropriate commands) and collect results. Write parsing logic to extract failures. Perhaps use the JSON output option of pytest for easier parsing. Do the same for behave (Behave has JSON or JUnit XML output options).
* Define how the orchestrator uses Validation results: if any fail, mark state and loop back to CodeAgent. If none fail, proceed to next step (or finish).
* Implement logic to avoid infinite loops: e.g., count iterations, and if >N, break and ask user for input.
* Integrate linting and static analysis in Validation Agent. For Python, add flake8 or pylint checks. If we find issues, either treat them as “failures” to fix or log them. Maybe start by just logging warnings, ensure pipeline doesn’t break. We can tighten later.
* Add the Refactoring capability: Perhaps add a node after all tests pass, like CodeAgent in refactor mode if any lint warnings remain or just as an optional step. This agent call could be similar to CodeAgent but prompt it with “Here is the working code, improve it without changing functionality.” Test this on a known refactor scenario (like code with duplicate logic).
* Now test the whole system on a moderately complex example. Something like a simple CRUD operation with 2-3 scenarios and a few unit tests. Observe how many iterations it needs, where it fails. Likely we’ll encounter scenarios where LLM doesn’t know something (maybe needs library usage). This will drive adding more context or refining prompts.
* Work on prompt engineering: ensure each agent’s prompt clearly states the task and format of output. Iteratively improve by testing. For example, get CodeAgent to only output code (we might have to parse out any explanations it gives).
* Milestone: System can handle a basic web API or similar, with multiple files, going through several cycles to fix failing tests, ending with all tests passed. Human can intervene if needed, but aim for minimal intervention in the happy path.

**Phase 5: Multi-Agent Refinement & Advanced Features**

* Introduce the **dual-agent dialogues** for critical steps (if not already). For code review: maybe implement a CodeReviewer agent and have the CodeAgent node internally call it. Or create two nodes: CodeDraftAgent and CodeReviewAgent in sequence. Ensure their interplay can modify the output before finalizing. Evaluate if this improves code quality (likely the CodeReviewAgent prompt might say “Review the following code for issues” and if issues found, either fix them or instruct the code agent to).
* Implement the **Diagram Agent**. Use a known example to generate a Mermaid diagram. Perhaps just do a class diagram of classes created. We can introspect the code structure to feed into prompt for diagram. Or generate from spec. Ensure we can call Mermaid to render to PNG/SVG and either display path to user or embed in some report.
* Implement any remaining specialized logic in Spec or Validation, such as cross-checking spec vs code coverage. Possibly incorporate the reasoning step explicitly: after all tests pass, call LLM to analyze spec vs implementation. This could be tricky to automate, but even a simple check like verifying each requirement has at least one test and at least one code reference might be enough (we can do that via metadata: tag scenarios with requirement id).
* Add support for at least one more language as a proof of extensibility. Maybe implement a simplified CodeAgent and TestAgent for JavaScript (which might just console.log or something trivial) to see what changes in orchestrator are needed. If the design is good, it should be mostly adding new classes and minimal core changes. This will validate our modular approach.
* Expand on security: add Bandit for Python and make CodeAgent respond to a simple vulnerability (like if it used `subprocess.call` unsafely, Bandit warns, CodeAgent changes it). We can simulate a scenario where an insecure practice is intentionally done to see if the pipeline catches and fixes it.
* Prepare documentation for users and contributors. Document how each agent works, how to add languages, how the CLI commands map to the process.
* Milestone: Release a v1.0 with full functionality for Python projects. Provide example demos (maybe in a examples/ folder) like a to-do app built by the AI with the user only providing high-level instructions.

**Phase 6: Testing & Evaluation of the Framework**

* Use the framework to build a few real small projects (or parts of projects) and evaluate the outcomes. Possibly compare time/effort vs doing it manually (informally).
* Fix bugs and address any stability issues encountered during these test runs. This phase might run in parallel with 4 and 5 as we test continuously.
* Write integration tests for the framework: e.g., run the CLI on a known input (maybe using a dummy OpenAI that returns predefined outputs for consistency) and assert the final files match expected. This might involve a lot of scaffolding (since OpenAI output is nondeterministic, we might have to simulate it for test).
* If possible, involve some external developers to try the tool and give feedback (usability testing). Use that to improve CLI messages, defaults, etc.

**Phase 7: Future Extensions (Beyond initial release)**
*(These are more speculative and can be planned once core is solid.)*

* Develop an IDE plugin that communicates with the CLI or uses the engine as library. This could provide a UI in VSCode for example.
* Add more agent types if useful, e.g., a *Documentation Agent* that writes project documentation or README at the end, summarizing features (it could compile from the spec and some of the discussion).
* Explore connecting to live project contexts: e.g., use the framework on an existing codebase to add a feature. That means reading existing code and docs as context (a big challenge but highly useful if solved).
* Community engagement: encourage contributions especially for new languages (maybe someone writes a Go agent, etc.). Ensure architecture makes this easy via plugins.
* Monitoring improvements: maybe integrate with a platform to monitor usage or gather telemetry (with consent) to identify where the AI gets stuck often, then improve that.

The above plan ensures that we build the system iteratively (very much eating our own dogfood by using iterative development to create an iterative development tool!). At each milestone, we’ll have a working subset that can be demonstrated, which reduces risk. The final product will be a comprehensive, extensible framework empowering AI-assisted software development with strong safeguards and alignment to best practices.

**Conclusion:** This specification has outlined a modular, multi-agent SDLC orchestration framework that merges state-of-the-art LLM capabilities with proven software engineering methodologies (BDD/TDD). By leveraging LangGraph’s structured orchestration and OpenAI’s powerful models, we aim to support developers in an interactive, dialectical development process—expanding ideas into implementations, rigorously testing and refining them, and doing so in a reproducible, observable manner. The system’s design prioritizes extensibility (to new languages and tools), quality (through testing, analysis, and best practices), and user control (human-in-the-loop oversight). We have identified current gaps in tooling and provided solutions, from improved agent coordination to better visualization.

Targeted at experienced developers and system designers, this framework should feel like working with an intelligent pair-programming assistant that not only writes code, but also writes the requirements and tests, checks its work, and learns from feedback. Our hope is that this can significantly accelerate development cycles while maintaining (or even raising) the quality bar – truly **“Ship Quality Faster”** as the Uber DPE team’s mantra goes. By systematically combining human insight with AI labor, this collaborative approach could become a blueprint for AI-assisted software engineering in the industry.
