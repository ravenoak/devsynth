# DevSynth Actionable Implementation Roadmap

**Note:** DevSynth is currently in a pre-release stage. The [Consolidated Roadmap](CONSOLIDATED_ROADMAP.md) is the canonical source for roadmap updates. Current implementation progress is summarized in the [Feature Status Matrix](../implementation/feature_status_matrix.md).

**Analysis Date:** July 16, 2025
**Repository:** https://github.com/ravenoak/devsynth.git
**Roadmap Timeline:** 24 months with quarterly milestones
**Implementation Approach:** Phased delivery with continuous validation

## Roadmap Overview

This roadmap transforms the comprehensive analysis findings into a practical, phased implementation plan that addresses critical gaps while building on DevSynth's exceptional architectural foundation. The approach prioritizes immediate adoption barriers, production readiness, and market validation while preserving the project's innovative AI-driven development vision.

### Strategic Phases

The high-level phases are consolidated in the
[Consolidated Roadmap](CONSOLIDATED_ROADMAP.md). Refer to that document for up-to-date
milestones and timelines.

## Provider Completion Summary

The Anthropic API provider and a deterministic offline provider are now fully
implemented. The Anthropic integration supports streaming completions and API
configuration, while the offline provider enables repeatable text and embeddings
when `offline_mode` is enabled. This ensures CLI and WebUI workflows operate
without network access.
Configuration examples are provided for optional vector stores such as **ChromaDB**, **Kuzu**, **FAISS**, and **LMDB**.
