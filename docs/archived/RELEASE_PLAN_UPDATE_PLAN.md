# DevSynth Release Plan Consolidation & Documentation Ecosystem

This document defines the consolidated release strategy and documentation ecosystem for DevSynth, resolving fragmentation across multiple plan files and automation gaps. It establishes a layered hierarchy of artifacts, version alignment, and CI/CD processes to maintain a single source of truth.

## Consolidation Vision

DevSynth currently maintains overlapping plan artifacts:

- `release_plan/RELEASE_PLAN.md` (v1.0 phases)
- `release_plan/metrics_feature.md` (metrics system proposal)
- `docs/specifications/post_mvp_roadmap.md` (post‑MVP development phases)
- `docs/specifications/post_mvp_documentation_plan.md` (post‑MVP docs strategy)
- `docs/specifications/edrr_framework_integration_plan.md` (EDRR integration draft)
- `RELEASE_PLAN_UPDATE_PLAN.md` (meta‑cleanup checklist)
- Deployment and documentation‑cleanup trackers

To eliminate duplication and ensure maintainability, we will converge these artifacts into a coherent docs/roadmap and docs/specifications structure, align version metadata, and automate CI/CD checks and release publishing.

## Consolidation Plan

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Move `release_plan/RELEASE_PLAN.md` → `docs/roadmap/release_plan.md` |
| 2 | Move `release_plan/metrics_feature.md` → `docs/specifications/metrics_system.md` |
| 3 | Move `docs/specifications/post_mvp_roadmap.md` → `docs/roadmap/post_mvp_roadmap.md` |
| 4 | Rename `docs/specifications/post_mvp_documentation_plan.md` → `docs/specifications/documentation_plan.md` |
| 5 | Archive `release_plan/` directory and retire `RELEASE_PLAN_UPDATE_PLAN.md` |
| 6 | Bump `pyproject.toml` to version 1.0.0 and align README metadata |
| 7 | Update README to reference new docs/roadmap paths |
| 8 | Re-enable and update documentation validation CI workflow |
| 9 | Add CI/CD workflow for release automation (tag, PyPI publish, docs deploy) |
| 10 | Update or generate `docs/documentation_index.md` to reflect new structure |
| 11 | Archive or integrate EDRR integration plan (`edrr_framework_integration_plan.md`) |

## Versioning & Packaging

- Ensure `pyproject.toml` version remains at **0.1.0** and update README front‑matter accordingly.
- Provide or update release automation scripts and workflows to tag, build, publish to PyPI, and deploy documentation.

## CI/CD & Maintenance Strategy

- Re-enable `validate_documentation.yml` to enforce metadata, link, and code‑snippet validation on PRs.
- Add a `release.yml` workflow to automate tagging, Poetry publish, and MkDocs site deploy.
- Maintain `docs/DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_PROGRESS.md` as the single documentation cleanup/progress tracker.
- Archive retired plan files under `docs/archived/` for historical reference.

By executing this plan, DevSynth will have a streamlined, maintainable, and automated release-and-documentation ecosystem that prevents drift, reduces duplication, and ensures clarity for all contributors.
## Implementation Status

This feature is **planned** and not yet implemented.
