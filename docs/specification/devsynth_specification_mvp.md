# DevSynth Application Technical Specification - MVP Version

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical specification for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version of the DevSynth application. The MVP focuses on delivering core functionality that provides immediate value to developers while establishing a foundation for future expansion.

The DevSynth is designed to streamline software development by providing AI-assisted automation for key phases of the software development lifecycle. The MVP will focus on project initialization, basic requirement analysis, test generation, and simple code generation capabilities, with a clear path for expansion to more advanced features in future iterations.

This specification defines clear MVP boundaries, prioritizes features, simplifies the initial architecture while preserving extension points, and provides concrete implementation guidance for core functionality.

## 2. System Overview and Purpose

### 2.1 Vision Statement

The DevSynth aims to enhance developer productivity by providing an AI-assisted command-line tool that automates routine aspects of the software development lifecycle while preserving developer agency and promoting best practices.

**MVP Focus**: Deliver a functional CLI tool that demonstrates value through basic project setup, requirement analysis, and test/code generation for simple Python modules.

### 2.2 Core Objectives

**MVP Objectives:**
1. Provide a simple, intuitive CLI interface for Python developers
2. Automate basic project initialization with standard Python project structure
3. Support requirement analysis and specification generation for simple modules
4. Generate basic unit tests following test-driven development principles
5. Generate functional code that passes the generated tests
6. Maintain a consistent project context across multiple CLI invocations

**Future Expansion Objectives** (not in MVP):
- Multi-agent collaboration for complex tasks
- Advanced code refactoring and optimization
- Comprehensive documentation generation
- Continuous learning from user feedback

### 2.3 Target Users

**MVP Target Users:**
1. Individual Python developers seeking productivity tools
2. Small development teams working on Python libraries or applications
3. Developers familiar with command-line tools and basic DevSynth concepts

The MVP will focus on serving these core users with straightforward use cases, with plans to expand to more diverse user groups in future versions.

### 2.4 Key Use Cases

**MVP Use Cases:**
1. Initialize a new Python project with standard structure and configuration
2. Generate a basic specification from user-provided requirements
3. Create unit tests based on specifications
4. Generate functional code that satisfies the tests
5. Refine generated artifacts through iterative prompting

**Implementation Priority:**
- High: Use cases 1-4 (core project workflow)
- Medium: Use case 5 (iterative refinement)

## 3. Architecture and Component Design

### 3.1 High-Level Architecture

The MVP architecture follows a simplified layered approach with clear separation of concerns:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  CLI Interface Layer                 │
└───────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┘
                            │
┌───────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┐
│               Orchestration Layer                    │
└───────────┬─────────────────────────────┬───────────┘
            │                             │
┌───────────┴───────────┐   ┌─────────────┴───────────┐
│    Agent System       │   │  Memory & Context System │
│    (Single Agent)     │   │                          │
└───────────┬───────────┘   └─────────────┬───────────┘
            │                             │
┌───────────┴─────────────────────────────┴───────────┐
│               LLM Backend Abstraction                │
