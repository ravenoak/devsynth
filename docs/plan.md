# Improvement Plan

## Goal
Prepare DevSynth for the v0.1.0-alpha.1 release.

## Current Status
- Python 3.12 environment with Poetry-managed virtualenv.
- `go-task` installed; `task --version` returns 3.44.1.
- Fast test suite passes (162 passed, 27 skipped).

## Next Steps
1. Audit remaining release-blocking issues, including pytest-xdist errors.
2. Document full release checklist and environment setup.
3. Expand tests for medium and slow speed categories.
