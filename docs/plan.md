# Stabilization and Improvement Plan

## Goal
Prepare DevSynth for the v0.1.0-alpha.1 release.

## Guiding Principles
- SDD + TDD + BDD; clarity, maintainability, safety.
- Offline-first and deterministic-by-default testing.
- Strict isolation in tests: no writes outside tmp paths; no network without explicit opt-in.

## Current Status
- Python 3.12 environment with Poetry-managed virtualenv.
- Fast tests succeed (162 passed, 27 skipped).
- scripts/verify_test_markers.py currently reports zero test files; marker enforcement pending.
- Medium suite exposed missing BDD steps and a failing AST workflow test; suite still red.
- Specifications include "What proofs confirm the solution?" sections linked to BDD features.
- Release readiness remains blocked by failing medium tests and unverified slow tests.

## Priorities for 0.1.0a1
1. Test isolation hardening
   - Enforce tmp-only writes via HOME redirection and Path.home() patch in tests.
   - Strengthen disable_network to block sockets, requests, and httpx.
2. Repo hygiene
   - Provide a script to verify clean working tree and absence of common artifacts.
3. Documentation pointers
   - Ensure Getting Started and Testing docs reference practical commands aligned with tasks.

## Next Steps
1. Investigate why scripts/verify_test_markers.py reports no test files and restore marker validation.
2. Resolve missing BDD steps and pytest-xdist errors so the medium suite completes, then re-run the slow suite.
3. After test suites and marker checks pass, follow the release checklist to finalize the release.

## Release Execution Quicklinks
- Consult the 0.1.0-alpha.1 release guide: docs/release/0.1.0-alpha.1.md
- Common commands:
  - poetry install --with dev --extras "tests retrieval chromadb api"
  - poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=fast
  - poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=medium
  - poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=slow
  - poetry run python tests/verify_test_organization.py
  - poetry run python scripts/verify_test_markers.py --report
  - poetry run python scripts/verify_requirements_traceability.py
  - poetry run python scripts/verify_version_sync.py

## Traceability and References
- docs/tasks.md (actionable checklist)
- docs/roadmap/release_plan.md
- docs/roadmap/development_plan.md
- docs/analysis/performance_plan.md

## Notes
This plan will be iteratively refined as tasks in docs/tasks.md are completed and verified in CI.
