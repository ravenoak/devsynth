# Improvement Plan

## Goal
Prepare DevSynth for the v0.1.0-alpha.1 release.

## Current Status
- Python 3.12 environment with Poetry-managed virtualenv.
- `go-task` installed; `task --version` returns 3.44.1.
- Fast tests succeed (162 passed, 27 skipped); `scripts/verify_test_markers.py` reports zero test files.
- Release readiness remains blocked by unresolved pytest-xdist assertion errors and unverified medium/slow tests.

## Next Steps
1. Document full release checklist and environment setup.
2. Investigate why `scripts/verify_test_markers.py` finds no test files.
3. Verify medium and slow test suites run cleanly to close pytest-xdist assertion issue.
