# Stabilization and Improvement Plan (docs/plan.md)

This plan captures the minimal, high-leverage stabilization activities for the 0.1.0a1 release and traces them to the actionable checklist in docs/tasks.md. It complements the detailed roadmap in docs/roadmap/release_plan.md.

## Guiding Principles
- Follow .junie/guidelines.md: SDD + TDD + BDD; clarity, maintainability, safety.
- Offline-first and deterministic-by-default testing.
- Strict isolation in tests: no writes outside tmp paths; no network without explicit opt-in.

## Priorities for 0.1.0a1
1. Test isolation hardening
   - Enforce tmp-only writes via HOME redirection and Path.home() patch in tests.
   - Strengthen disable_network to block sockets, requests, and httpx.
2. Repo hygiene
   - Provide a script to verify clean working tree and absence of common artifacts.
3. Documentation pointers
   - Ensure Getting Started and Testing docs reference practical commands aligned with tasks.

## Traceability to tasks
- Task 31.153: Disable network for integration runs — achieved via enhanced fixture.
- Task 33.162-33.163: Test data/temp isolation and cleanup — achieved via HOME redirection and fixture cleanup.
- Task 2.11: Baseline repo hygiene — supported by scripts/check_repo_hygiene.py (local/CI verification).

For broader milestones, refer to:
- docs/roadmap/release_plan.md
- docs/roadmap/development_plan.md
- docs/analysis/performance_plan.md

## Notes
This plan will be iteratively refined as tasks in docs/tasks.md are completed and verified in CI.
