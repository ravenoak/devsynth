# Requirement Analysis Tests Implementation

This document describes the implementation of behavior tests for the requirement analysis feature of DevSynth.

## Overview

The requirement inspection feature allows users to inspect requirements from a text file or through an interactive session. The behavior tests verify that the system correctly handles both scenarios.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Feature File

The `requirement_analysis.feature` file defines two scenarios:
- Analyzing requirements from a text file
- Interactive requirement gathering

Each scenario includes steps that verify the system's behavior when analyzing requirements.

### 2. Step Definitions

The step definitions in `requirement_analysis_steps.py` implement the steps defined in the feature file:

- `@given("I have initialized a DevSynth project")`: Sets up an initialized DevSynth project using the `tmp_project_dir` fixture.
- `@given("I have a requirements file "{filename}"")`: Creates a sample requirements file in the project directory.
- `@then("the system should parse the requirements")`: Verifies that the system parsed the requirements by checking that the inspect command was called.
- `@then("create a structured representation in the memory system")`: Verifies that a structured representation was created in the memory system.
- `@then("generate a requirements summary")`: Verifies that a requirements summary was generated.
- `@then("the system should start an interactive session")`: Verifies that an interactive session was started by checking that the inspect command was called with the interactive flag.
- `@then("ask me questions about my requirements")`: Verifies that the system asked questions about requirements.

### 3. CLI Command Implementation

To support the requirement analysis feature, we added:

1. A new `inspect_cmd` function in `commands.py` that handles both file-based and interactive requirement inspection.
2. Updated the CLI adapter in `typer_adapter.py` to include the inspect command in the help message, argument parser, and command handler.
3. Added workflow steps for requirement analysis in `workflow.py`.

### 4. Test Runner

The test runner in `test_requirement_analysis.py` imports the step definitions and runs the scenarios defined in the feature file.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Mock Workflow Manager**: We needed to ensure that the mock workflow manager was correctly called with the expected arguments. We updated the CLI command steps to handle the inspect command and set up the mock correctly.

2. **Error Handling**: We improved error handling in the step definitions to provide better error messages when assertions fail.

3. **Command Parsing**: We implemented parsing for the inspect command arguments to support both file-based and interactive modes.

## Future Improvements

1. **More Detailed Tests**: Add more detailed tests for specific aspects of requirement analysis, such as handling different types of requirements.

2. **Error Cases**: Add tests for error cases, such as invalid requirements files or interrupted interactive sessions.

3. **Integration Tests**: Add integration tests that verify the end-to-end flow from requirement analysis to code generation.

## Interactive Flow Behavior Tests

The interactive flow expands requirement analysis beyond the original CLI. New behavior tests ensure the same logic works in both the command line and upcoming WebUI.

### CLI and WebUI Scenarios

- `interactive_flow_cli.feature` covers the prompts, confirmations, and summary generation when users run `devsynth inspect --interactive` from the CLI.
- `interactive_flow_webui.feature` mirrors these steps using the WebUI through the `UXBridge` abstraction.
- Both files live in `tests/behavior/features` and rely on `UXBridge` mocks similar to the `DummyBridge` used in `interactive_requirements_steps.py`.

### Agent HTTP API Scenarios

- `agent_http_api.feature` outlines how external clients interact with the agent HTTP API.
- Scenarios verify endpoints for launching workflows, retrieving status, and capturing results.
- These tests also utilize `UXBridge` mocks so the API behaves consistently with interactive sessions.
## Implementation Status

This feature is **implemented** and validated by the behavior test suite.
