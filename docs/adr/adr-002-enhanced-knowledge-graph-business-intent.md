# ADR-002: Enhanced Knowledge Graph with Business Intent Layer

## Context

The current DevSynth knowledge graph provides basic code structure representation but lacks semantic linking between business requirements and technical implementation. Research from inspirational documents reveals a "Meaning Barrier" where AI systems understand "what" code does but not "why" it exists or what business requirements it fulfills.

## Problem Statement

Current limitations:
- 81% failure rate on semantically equivalent code with different variable names
- Inability to connect implementation to business value
- Limited impact analysis capabilities
- Poor requirement-to-implementation traceability

## Decision

**ADOPT** enhanced knowledge graph architecture with business intent layer that:

1. **Extends Entity Schema**: Add business logic entities (BusinessRequirement, DesignDecision, UserJourney) alongside technical entities
2. **Implements Intent Discovery**: Automatically discover relationships between business requirements and code implementation
3. **Enables Multi-Hop Reasoning**: Support complex queries traversing business and technical layers
4. **Provides Semantic Linking**: Bridge meaning barrier through semantic similarity and intent analysis

## Rationale

### Alternatives Considered

**Option 1: Vector-Only Enhancement**
- **Pros**: Simpler implementation, leverages existing vector capabilities
- **Cons**: Limited relationship traversal, poor traceability, no structural understanding
- **Rejection**: Insufficient for complex multi-hop queries and business context requirements

**Option 2: Fine-Tuning LLM for Domain Knowledge**
- **Pros**: Direct knowledge injection, immediate availability
- **Cons**: Expensive retraining, knowledge staleness, black-box reasoning
- **Rejection**: Not research-backed, limited explainability, poor maintenance

**Option 3: Enhanced Knowledge Graph (CHOSEN)**
- **Pros**: Research-backed approach, verifiable reasoning, complete traceability
- **Cons**: More complex implementation, requires graph expertise
- **Selection**: Addresses core "Meaning Barrier" problem, provides comprehensive solution

### Evidence Supporting Decision

1. **Research Alignment**: Directly implements findings from "From Code to Context" and "LLM Code Comprehension" papers
2. **Empirical Evidence**: Addresses documented 81% semantic mutation failure rate
3. **Architectural Fit**: Builds on existing hybrid memory and GraphRAG infrastructure
4. **Quality Standards**: Maintains backward compatibility and performance requirements

## Solution Details

### Enhanced Entity Schema

```python
# Business Logic Entities (NEW)
business_entities = {
    "BusinessRequirement": {
        "properties": ["id", "description", "priority", "business_value", "acceptance_criteria"],
        "relationships": ["IMPLEMENTED_BY", "VALIDATED_BY", "DEPENDS_ON", "CONFLICTS_WITH"]
    },
    "DesignDecision": {
        "properties": ["decision_text", "alternatives_considered", "trade_offs", "decision_date"],
        "relationships": ["LEADS_TO", "CONSTRAINS", "ENABLES", "REVERSED_BY"]
    }
}

# Enhanced Technical Entities
technical_entities = {
    "Function": {
        "properties": ["name", "signature", "complexity", "business_purpose", "technical_debt"],
        "relationships": ["CALLS", "CALLED_BY", "IMPLEMENTS", "VALIDATES", "DEPENDS_ON"]
    }
}

# Intent and Rationale Entities (NEW)
intent_entities = {
    "ImplementationIntent": {
        "properties": ["intent_description", "design_rationale", "acceptance_criteria", "risks"],
        "relationships": ["EXPRESSES", "SATISFIES", "CONSTRAINS", "VALIDATES"]
    }
}
```

### Intent Discovery Engine

Automatically discovers business intent behind code:

```python
class IntentDiscoveryEngine:
    """Engine for discovering and validating intent relationships."""

    def discover_business_intent(self, code_entity: Entity, graph: KnowledgeGraph) -> List[IntentLink]:
        """Discover business intent behind code implementation."""
        # Analyze function names and comments for business context
        name_intent = self._analyze_name_intent(code_entity)

        # Analyze commit messages and documentation
        commit_intent = self._analyze_commit_intent(code_entity, graph)

        # Analyze test coverage and validation
        test_intent = self._analyze_test_intent(code_entity, graph)

        # Cross-reference with business requirements
        requirement_links = self._link_to_requirements(code_entity, graph)

        return [name_intent, commit_intent, test_intent] + requirement_links
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Implement enhanced entity schema
- Add business intent discovery engine
- Integrate with existing knowledge graph

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Weeks 3-4)
- Implement multi-hop reasoning capabilities
- Add semantic linking algorithms
- Create validation framework

### Phase 3: Integration (Weeks 5-6)
- Integrate with EDRR framework
- Enhance agent capabilities
- Add comprehensive testing

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Enhanced AI Reasoning**: Agents understand business context, not just code syntax
- **Complete Traceability**: End-to-end traceability from requirements to implementation
- **Impact Analysis**: Accurate assessment of change impacts across business and technical layers
- **Research Alignment**: Implements cutting-edge research findings

### Negative
- **Increased Complexity**: More complex graph operations and maintenance
- **Performance Overhead**: Additional processing for intent discovery and linking
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand enhanced schema and relationships

### Risk Mitigation
- **Feature Flags**: Enable/disable enhanced features independently
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of query performance and memory usage
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing graph operations continue to work unchanged
- **Gradual Migration**: Phase-based implementation with validation at each step

## Validation

### Success Metrics
- **Intent Discovery Accuracy**: >80% accuracy in linking code to business requirements
- **Multi-Hop Query Success**: >85% accuracy on complex traceability queries
- **Performance Impact**: <15% overhead compared to current system
- **Backward Compatibility**: 100% compatibility with existing graph operations

### Research-Backed Validation
- **Semantic Robustness Testing**: Validate understanding through mutation analysis
