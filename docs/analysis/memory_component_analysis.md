# Memory Component Algorithmic Analysis

## Algorithmic Invariants
- **Transactional Integrity:** Every write across memory stores commits atomically, preventing partial state updates.
- **Consistency Preservation:** Cross-store synchronization maintains eventual consistency using a last-write-wins policy.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Sync Manager:** \(O(n)\) where *n* is the number of records synchronized.
- **Cross-Store Query:** \(O(n)\) time for result size *n*, with hash-based lookups for stores.

## Simulation Outline

```python
for record in dataset:
    write(record)        # atomic per store
sync_all()               # linear traversal to propagate writes
```
