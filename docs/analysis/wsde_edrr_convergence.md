# WSDE/EDRR Convergence

This document analyzes the convergence behavior of a Weighted Stochastic Dialectical Exploration (WSDE) cycle coupled with the Expand–Differentiate–Refine–Retrospect (EDRR) coordination strategy.

## Assumptions

- Agents exchange scalar opinions each round.
- The WSDE weight matrix is row‑stochastic and strongly connected.
- Noise introduced during *Expand* has zero mean and bounded variance.
- The step size used in *Refine* satisfies ``0 < \eta < 1`` ensuring contraction.

## Complexity

Let ``n`` denote the number of agents and ``T`` the iterations until convergence.

- Communication per round: ``O(n^2)`` message exchanges.
- Local update per agent: ``O(1)`` operations.
- Overall computational cost: ``O(n^2 T)``.

## Convergence Properties

Under the stated assumptions, the EDRR cycle forms a contraction mapping with factor ``(1-\eta)``. Standard results for stochastic consensus imply:

- **Almost‑sure convergence** to the average of initial opinions.
- **Linear rate** ``|x_t - \bar{x}| \le (1-\eta)^t |x_0 - \bar{x}|`` in expectation.
- Noise variance diminishes geometrically; bounded variance prevents divergence.

These properties are illustrated by the companion simulation script [`scripts/wsde_edrr_simulation.py`](../../scripts/wsde_edrr_simulation.py).

## Future Work

- Extend the analysis to heterogeneous step sizes and asynchronous updates.
- Formalize bounds for higher‑order moments under heavy‑tailed noise.
