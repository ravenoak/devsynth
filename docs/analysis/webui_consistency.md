# WebUI Consistency Analysis

This document examines theoretical consistency in the WebUI core via a simplified state-transition model.

## State-Transition Diagram
```
[Idle] -> [Route Query] -> [Render View] -> [Format Output] -> [Completed]
          ^                                      |
          |--------------------------------------|
```

## Discussion
- **Idle**: No user interaction yet.
- **Route Query**: Incoming requests are directed to memory stores according to strategy.
- **Render View**: Selected data is transformed into a dashboard without external network calls.
- **Format Output**: Results are formatted for display or CLI emission.
- **Completed**: The cycle ends, returning to `Idle` for further actions.

This progression reinforces consistent behavior across rendering, routing, and formatting components.
