# Synchronization Algorithm Proof

## Problem
Distributed memory replicas must converge after transactions commit while remaining isolated during rollbacks.

## Algorithm
Let stores \(A\) and \(B\) maintain item maps. After store \(A\) commits a transaction, it propagates its state to \(B\) via a copy operation; rollbacks discard local changes and nothing is sent.

## Proof
We prove that both stores converge after every committed transaction.

1. **Local Consistency:** Transactional semantics ensure store \(A\)'s state after commit equals its pre-transaction state plus applied operations.
2. **Propagation:** The sync step copies \(A\)'s state to \(B\), so \(B\)'s state becomes identical to \(A\)'s.
3. **Rollback Isolation:** If the transaction rolls back, \(A\) returns to its prior state and no sync occurs, leaving \(B\) unchanged.
4. **Induction:** Repeating the above for each transaction maintains invariance \(A = B\) after commits.

Therefore, the algorithm yields eventual consistency between replicas without leaking rolled-back operations.
