# Test Marker Verification Benchmark

Caching pytest collection results in `.pytest_collection_cache.json` keeps the
`verify_test_markers` script under a minute even for the entire suite.
Benchmarks were recorded on an 8â€‘core Linux runner with Python 3.12.

| Run type | Workers | Time (s) |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Cold start (no cache) | 4 | 52.4 |
| Warm cache | 4 | 14.2 |
| `--changed` (single file) | 4 | 3.8 |

Subsequent invocations reuse the cache and validate only modified files,
providing fast feedback during development.
