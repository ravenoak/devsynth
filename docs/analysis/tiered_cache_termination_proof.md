# Tiered Cache Termination Proof

## Overview
The `TieredCache` provides an LRU eviction strategy with a fixed maximum size. We show that its operations complete after a finite number of steps and outline how to benchmark their performance.

## Termination Proof
Let `C` be a cache with bound `max_size = M`.

- `put(key, value)` performs at most three constant-time steps:
  1. Update and promote if `key` exists.
  2. Evict the least recently used key if the cache already holds `M` entries.
  3. Insert the new entry.
  Each step touches at most one element, so the function terminates in \(O(1)\).
- `get(key)` looks up `key` in a dictionary and optionally promotes it to most-recently-used. Both actions are constant time, so the call terminates.
- `remove(key)` deletes at most one entry, again bounded by \(O(1)\).

Because every loop iterates over at most `M` elements, all operations terminate.

## Simulation Plan
Benchmark `put` and `get` latency with the existing performance test:

```bash
poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=slow --target tests/performance/test_cache_benchmarks.py
```
