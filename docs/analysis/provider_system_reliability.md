# Provider System Reliability

This document analyzes the retry and circuit‑breaker mechanisms guarding LM Studio provider calls. The implementation wraps network calls in a resilience function that combines exponential‑backoff retries with a circuit breaker.

## Algorithm overview

LM Studio requests are routed through `_execute_with_resilience`, which decorates the outbound call with `retry_with_exponential_backoff` and forwards execution through a `CircuitBreaker` instance【F:src/devsynth/application/llm/lmstudio_provider.py†L60-L74】【F:src/devsynth/application/llm/lmstudio_provider.py†L123-L134】. The breaker tracks consecutive failures and trips after a configured threshold, while the retry decorator backs off after each failure according to exponential policy.

The `CircuitBreaker` maintains CLOSED, OPEN, and HALF_OPEN states and transitions to OPEN once the failure count exceeds the configured threshold【F:src/devsynth/fallback.py†L807-L820】【F:src/devsynth/fallback.py†L916-L980】.

## Failure‑rate formulas

Let `p` denote the independent failure probability of a single provider call, `r` the maximum number of retries, and `k` the circuit‑breaker failure threshold.

* **Retry reliability.** The probability that all attempts fail is `p^{r+1}`; therefore overall success probability is `1 - p^{r+1}`.
* **Circuit‑breaker trip rate.** The probability of triggering the breaker on any run of `k` consecutive failures is `p^k`.

## Monte‑Carlo simulation

The following experiment simulated 10,000 provider calls with `p = 0.3`, `r = 3`, and `k = 3` using the project’s resilience utilities:

```text
success 9906 fail 94 cb_opens 31
```

Observed success rate (99.06 %) closely matches the theoretical value `1 - 0.3^4 ≈ 99.19 %`, while the breaker opened 31 times (≈0.31 %) as only a subset of failure sequences reached the threshold because retries reset the failure counter.

## Proof of reliability

Let `p` denote the probability that a single provider call fails independently, `r` the maximum number of retries, and `k` the circuit‑breaker failure threshold.

* **Overall failure probability.** The system succeeds unless every attempt fails, giving `p^{r+1}` as the chance of an overall failure.
* **Breaker trip probability.** The circuit breaker trips only after `k` consecutive failures, so the probability of tripping on any run is `p^k`.

For example, with `p = 0.2`, `r = 2`, and `k = 3`, the probability of complete failure is `0.2^3 = 0.008` (0.8 %), yielding a reliability of `1 - 0.008 = 99.2 %`. The breaker trips with the same probability `0.2^3`, demonstrating mathematically that the combined retry and breaker strategy sharply reduces risk.
