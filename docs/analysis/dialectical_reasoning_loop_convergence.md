## Socratic Checklist
- **What is the problem?**
  The dialectical reasoning loop in `src/devsynth/methodology/edrr/reasoning_loop.py` iterates to synthesize solutions. We must ensure the loop terminates and yields correct results.
- **What proofs confirm the solution?**
  We provide a termination proof and cite unit and behavior tests that simulate successful and bounded execution.

## Algorithm Overview
The loop applies `apply_dialectical_reasoning` up to `max_iterations` times, breaking early when a result reports `status="completed"` or when a `ConsensusError` occurs. Each iteration may update the task with a synthesized solution before the next step.

## Convergence Proof
Let `i` denote the iteration index starting at 0. The loop condition is `for iteration in range(max_iterations)`, so `i < max_iterations`. At the end of each iteration `i` increments by 1. Therefore `i` can take at most `max_iterations` values. Additionally, if any iteration yields a result with `status="completed"`, the loop breaks immediately. Thus the loop terminates after at most `max_iterations` iterations, establishing convergence.

### Variant-Based Termination
Define the variant `v(i) = max_iterations - i` over the natural numbers.  The loop in
[`reasoning_loop`](../../src/devsynth/methodology/edrr/reasoning_loop.py) decreases
`v` by one on each pass and halts when `v(i) = 0` or when a result reports
`status="completed"`【F:src/devsynth/methodology/edrr/reasoning_loop.py†L33-L54】.
Because `v` is non‑negative and strictly decreases, the iteration is well founded
and must terminate for any finite `max_iterations`.

## Simulation Results
Unit tests [`tests/unit/methodology/test_dialectical_reasoning_loop.py`](../../tests/unit/methodology/test_dialectical_reasoning_loop.py) confirm three scenarios:
1. **Completion:** The loop stops when a result marks completion.
2. **Consensus Failure:** Errors trigger coordinator logging and halt the loop.
3. **Bounded Iterations:** The loop respects a caller-provided `max_iterations`.

Property-based tests [`tests/property/test_reasoning_loop_properties.py`](../../tests/property/test_reasoning_loop_properties.py)
randomly generate intermediate statuses and `max_iterations` values.  The tests
verify that the loop never exceeds `max_iterations` and stops on the first
`status="completed"`, providing empirical confirmation of convergence.

Behavior test [`tests/behavior/test_dialectical_reasoner_termination_behavior.py`](../../tests/behavior/test_dialectical_reasoner_termination_behavior.py) exercises termination in an integration context, validating the same invariants across the orchestration layer.
