# Memory Adapter Performance Simulation

## Overview

This simulation benchmarks the TinyDB, DuckDB, LMDB, and Kuzu adapters using a simple `time.perf_counter` measurement. Each run stores 100 items to assess write performance across adapters.

## Methodology

- Parameterized benchmark over available adapters
- For each adapter:
  1. Initialize an isolated store path
  2. Store 100 `MemoryItem` instances
  3. Record execution time with `time.perf_counter`

## Running the Simulation

```bash
poetry run devsynth run-tests --speed=slow --target tests/performance/test_memory_adapter_simulation.py
```

## Interpretation

- **TinyDB**: linear-time JSON storage suited for lightweight tasks
- **DuckDB**: log-time analytical engine with vector support
- **LMDB**: log-time B+ tree with durable transactions
- **Kuzu**: log-time graph store optimized for relationships

These results guide backend selection based on workload characteristics.
