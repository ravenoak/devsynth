# WSDE Voting Fairness

This document analyzes the probabilistic guarantees of WSDE voting mechanisms.
Tie-breaking and weighted voting rely on uniform random selection when options
are evenly matched.

## Probabilistic Tie-Breaking

When multiple options receive identical support, the implementation selects a
winner uniformly at random. With *n* tied options, each has probability
:math:`1/n` of being chosen. Supplying a seedable ``random.Random`` instance
makes the selection deterministic across runs while preserving the uniform
probability distribution. This ensures no option is systematically favored.

## Weighted Voting

Weighted voting assigns greater influence to agents with domain expertise.
Weights accumulate per option, and the highest total wins. If weighted totals
tie, the same uniform tie-breaking applies. Thus, regardless of weight
configuration, tied options share equal chance of selection.

## Simulation Evidence

The deterministic simulations in
``tests/unit/domain/models/test_wsde_voting_logic.py`` exercise both
majority and weighted voting paths. By iterating over fixed RNG seeds, the tests
confirm that tie-breaking remains unbiased and reproducible.
