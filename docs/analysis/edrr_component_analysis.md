# EDRR Component Algorithmic Analysis

## Algorithmic Invariants
- **Bounded Recursion:** The recursion depth never exceeds the configured threshold, preventing infinite loops.
- **Phase Transition Validity:** Each phase transition occurs only after all prerequisite checks pass.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Cycle Coordination:** \(O(k)\) where *k* is the number of phases in the cycle.
- **Recovery Mechanism:** \(O(r)\) for *r* retries during failure recovery.

## Simulation Outline

```python
for phase in phases:
    verify(phase)
    execute(phase)
    if failure:
        recover()  # bounded by retry policy
```
