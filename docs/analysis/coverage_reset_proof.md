# Coverage Reset Algorithm Proof

The coverage reset routine clears the set of executed lines between test runs.
Let \(C_i\) be the set of lines executed in test \(i\). The algorithm maintains the invariant
\(S = \varnothing\) before each test by invoking `reset()`.

**Lemma.** After calling `reset()`, the tracker holds no lines: \(S' = \varnothing\).

**Proof.** `reset()` assigns \(S \leftarrow \varnothing\). Therefore \(S' = \varnothing\). \(\square\)

**Theorem.** Across \(n\) tests, the cumulative coverage equals \(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} C_i\) with no cross-test contamination.

**Proof.** At the start of test \(i\), \(S = \varnothing\). Executing the test populates \(S = C_i\).
Calling `reset()` restores \(S = \varnothing\) before test \(i+1\).
Thus, coverage from one test never leaks into another, and the union of per-test sets
is the total coverage. \(\square\)
