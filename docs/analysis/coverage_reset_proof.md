# Coverage Reset Algorithm Proof

## Problem
Test coverage metrics accumulate across multiple test runs. Without resetting, the probability space for uncovered lines becomes non-stationary, obscuring regression detection.

## Algorithm
After every \(N\) tests, reset coverage counters to zero. Let \(C_j\) denote the set of lines covered during batch \(j\).

## Proof
We show that coverage after each reset reflects only the most recent batch.

1. **Initialization:** Before batch \(j\), counters are zero, so the coverage set is \(C_0 = \emptyset\).
2. **Induction:** Assume after batch \(j-1\) the coverage set is \(C_{j-1}\). Resetting sets counters to zero, producing \(C'_j = \emptyset\).
3. **Execution:** Running the next \(N\) tests yields coverage \(C_j = \bigcup_{t=1}^{N} L_t\), where \(L_t\) is the set of lines executed by test \(t\).
4. **Disjointness:** By construction, \(C_j\) depends only on the tests in batch \(j\); previous batches do not influence it because the reset erased \(C_{j-1}\).

Thus, coverage after each reset is isolated to the latest batch, preserving independence between batches.
