# Task Progress

This document tracks high-level progress on the DevSynth roadmap. Refer to
`docs/roadmap/development_status.md` for detailed milestones.

## Current Status

- Repository harmonization phases completed.
- Provider subsystem supports Anthropic API and deterministic offline mode.

## Outstanding Tasks (from `development_status.md`)

- Investigate failing Web UI and Kuzu-related tests; implement fixes for the
  requirements wizard and memory initialization logic.
- Some CLI and ingestion workflows still require interactive prompts. Related
  unit tests are conditionally skipped unless the environment variable
  flags `DEVSYNTH_RUN_INGEST_TESTS` or `DEVSYNTH_RUN_WSDE_TESTS` are enabled.
