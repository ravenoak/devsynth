# Task Progress

This document tracks high-level progress on the DevSynth roadmap. Refer to
`docs/roadmap/development_status.md` for detailed milestones.

## Current Status

- Repository harmonization phases completed.
- Provider subsystem supports Anthropic API and deterministic offline mode.
- Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization complete. Success criteria validated.
- Type annotation issues fixed by replacing pipe operator (|) with Union from typing module.
- Web UI requirements wizard navigation and state persistence issues fixed.
- Kuzu memory initialization logic improved with better error handling and fallback mechanisms.

## Outstanding Tasks (from `development_status.md`)

- Some CLI and ingestion workflows still require interactive prompts. Related
  unit tests previously required the `DEVSYNTH_RUN_INGEST_TESTS` or
  `DEVSYNTH_RUN_WSDE_TESTS` flags. These tests now run by default in the
  isolated test environment.

## Recent Improvements (2025-07-30)

### Type Annotation Fixes
- Fixed type annotation issues across the codebase by replacing the pipe operator (|) with Union from the typing module.
- Created a script (`scripts/fix_type_annotations.py`) to systematically fix type annotations.
- Fixed 28 files in total (22 in src and 6 in tests).

### Web UI Requirements Wizard Fixes
- Improved state persistence in the requirements wizard by creating helper functions for consistent session state access.
- Enhanced navigation between wizard steps with better error handling.
- Fixed state reset logic when saving requirements.

### Kuzu Memory System Fixes
- Improved initialization logic in KuzuMemoryStore with explicit handling of the use_embedded parameter.
- Added better error handling during initialization to ensure graceful fallback.
- Enhanced directory creation and validation to prevent initialization failures.
- Improved embedder initialization with better error handling.

### WSDE Agent Collaboration Integration with Memory System
- Extended MemoryType enum with collaboration-specific types (COLLABORATION_TASK, COLLABORATION_MESSAGE, COLLABORATION_TEAM, PEER_REVIEW).
- Implemented serialization/deserialization methods for collaboration entities in a new collaboration_memory_utils.py module.
- Modified AgentCollaborationSystem to integrate with the memory system:
  - Added memory_manager parameter to constructor
  - Updated create_task, send_message, and create_team methods to store data in memory
  - Added helper methods (_get_task, _get_message, _get_team) to retrieve data from memory
  - Updated assign_task and execute_task methods to update task status in memory
  - Implemented cross-store synchronization with transactions for atomic operations
  - Added comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- Maintained backward compatibility by preserving in-memory dictionaries alongside persistent storage.

### Peer Review Workflow with Cross-Store Synchronization
- Enhanced PeerReview class to fully integrate with the memory system:
  - Added store_in_memory method for persisting review data with proper error handling
  - Implemented helper methods for transaction management (_start_transaction, _commit_transaction, _rollback_transaction)
  - Added _get_primary_store method to determine the optimal storage adapter
- Implemented cross-store synchronization for review data:
  - Used collaboration_memory_utils.py functions for consistent serialization/deserialization
  - Integrated with memory_manager's sync_manager for cross-store synchronization
  - Ensured proper use of MemoryType.PEER_REVIEW for consistent type identification
- Added transaction support for atomic operations:
  - Wrapped all memory operations in transactions to ensure data consistency
  - Implemented proper commit/rollback logic based on operation success
  - Added transaction support at both method level and workflow level
- Improved error handling for review operations:
  - Added comprehensive try-except blocks with detailed error logging
  - Implemented graceful degradation with fallback mechanisms
  - Ensured backward compatibility for environments without memory system
- Updated PeerReviewWorkflow class and run_peer_review function:
  - Added memory_manager parameter to both for consistent memory integration
  - Implemented transaction support for the entire workflow process
  - Added error handling with proper logging and fallback mechanisms
