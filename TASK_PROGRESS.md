## Blockers and Issues

- Comprehensive testing infrastructure is now in place with scripts for:
  - Executing all unit, integration, and behavior tests
  - Performing manual testing of CLI workflows
  - Testing WebUI navigation and functionality
  - Verifying Agent API with external clients
  - Testing with different configuration options
- These scripts provide a solid foundation for ongoing testing and quality assurance
- The test categorization system allows for more efficient test execution and better understanding of test performance
- Test data generators provide consistent test inputs, making tests more reliable and easier to maintain
- Comprehensive testing standards documentation provides clear guidance for writing tests
- Subsystem documentation is now complete, with comprehensive coverage of provider system, WebUI architecture, and EDRR/WSDE integration
- Next focus should be on performance and security verification, followed by release preparation
- No major blockers currently exist, but attention should be paid to:
  - Ensuring all tests pass with the latest implementation
  - Addressing any performance issues identified during testing
  - Conducting thorough security scanning and vulnerability assessment
  - Ensuring documentation is consistent with the latest implementation details

## Next Steps

1. Complete Performance and Security Verification
   - Conduct performance testing under load
   - Implement security scanning and vulnerability assessment
   - Test memory usage and resource consumption
   - Verify error handling and recovery
   - Document performance characteristics

2. Prepare for Release
   - Update version numbers
   - Create release notes
   - Prepare deployment artifacts
   - Update changelog
   - Create release branch/tag

3. Execute Comprehensive Tests
   - Run all unit, integration, and behavior tests using scripts/run_all_tests.py
   - Perform manual testing of CLI workflows using scripts/manual_cli_testing.py
   - Test WebUI navigation and functionality using scripts/webui_testing.py
   - Verify Agent API with external clients using scripts/agent_api_testing.py
   - Test with different configuration options using scripts/config_testing.py
