"""
Verify that declared entry points in pyproject.toml resolve to callable targets
and that the primary CLI can produce help output without executing external
systems.

This script does not require network and should run in any environment where
DevSynth is installed (editable or sdist/wheel). It supports Packaging Sanity
(Task 29) by providing a quick local integrity check for entry points.

Checks performed:
- Import and call devsynth.adapters.cli.typer_adapter:run_cli with --help
  using Typer's CliRunner to avoid launching a real process.
- Import mvuu-dashboard entry point target and ensure it is callable.

Exit codes:
- 0 on success
- non-zero on failure with a concise diagnostic message
