### Added
- Autoresearch overlays for the MVUU dashboard can now be toggled via
  `mvuu-dashboard --research-overlays`, emitting signed telemetry consumed by
  Streamlit overlays and documented in `docs/user_guides/mvuu_dashboard.md`.

### Changed
- Lifted the repo-wide strict typing guard to cover `src/devsynth`, routing `task mypy:strict` through `poetry run mypy --strict src/devsynth`, leaning on the mypy configuration smoke tests for regression detection, and archiving the clean transcript at `diagnostics/mypy_strict_src_devsynth_20251003T172126Z.txt`; the updated strictness note cross-links the enforcement details for ongoing review.【F:Taskfile.yml†L143-L147】【F:tests/unit/general/test_mypy_config.py†L1-L70】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_src_devsynth_20251003T172126Z.txt†L1-L1】【F:docs/typing/strictness.md†L9-L12】
- Enforced a dedicated strict typing guard for the memory stack by removing the override exemption, wiring `task mypy:strict` to archive the new transcript, and extending the guardrail runner; diagnostics live at `diagnostics/mypy_strict_application_memory_20251002T220045Z.txt` for ongoing verification.【F:pyproject.toml†L321-L333】【F:Taskfile.yml†L143-L152】【F:scripts/run_guardrails_suite.py†L41-L64】【F:docs/typing/strictness.md†L5-L27】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_application_memory_20251002T220045Z.txt†L1-L200】
- Brought the Agent API and requirements service stack under the strict typing gate, removing the Phase‑5 override and archiving fresh mypy/test diagnostics as release evidence.【F:docs/typing/strictness.md†L18-L21】【F:docs/typing/strictness.md†L130-L136】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_agentapi_requirements_20250929T162537Z.txt†L1-L106】【F:diagnostics/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_api_strict_20250929T163210Z.txt†L1-L20】
- Removed legacy strict-typing overrides for adapters and application workflows after strict sweeps, consolidating the `pyproject.toml` configuration and archiving diagnostics for each batch.【F:pyproject.toml†L285-L309】【F:docs/typing/strictness.md†L15-L23】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_adapters_20250930T201103Z.txt†L1-L2】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_application_orchestration_20250930T201117Z.txt†L1-L2】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_application_prompts_20250930T201132Z.txt†L1-L2】
- Updated release readiness documentation to reinforce the ≥90 % coverage gate, strict mypy verification via `poetry run task mypy:strict`, and fast+medium artifact archival workflows, referencing the latest diagnostics evidence.
- Documented the 2025-10-04 strict mypy success and staged coverage remediation milestones across `docs/plan.md`, `docs/release/0.1.0-alpha.1.md`, and `issues/coverage-below-threshold.md`, highlighting the knowledge-graph publication banner and pending evidence folders for each milestone.【F:docs/plan.md†L1-L8】【F:docs/plan.md†L176-L182】【F:docs/release/0.1.0-alpha.1.md†L20-L23】【F:issues/coverage-below-threshold.md†L1-L12】
- Updated the FastAPI optional extras to 0.115.5—covering the Pydantic 2.10
  compatibility refactor—and aligned Starlette with 0.41.3's `TestClient`
  `raw_path` regression fix. The `sitecustomize` shim continues to patch
  `WebSocketDenialResponse` until the upstream Python 3.12 TestClient MRO fix
  lands natively (tracked in
  `issues/run-tests-smoke-fast-fastapi-starlette-mro.md`).
- Recorded the 2025-09-30 strict and fast+medium runs for the CLI and collaboration stacks after pruning their overrides, capturing the outstanding mypy violations and the Pydantic recursion loop blocking regression coverage.【F:docs/typing/strictness.md†L18-L21】【F:docs/typing/strictness.md†L66-L79】【F:diagnostics/mypy_strict_cli_collaboration_20250930T013408Z.txt†L1-L200】【F:diagnostics/devsynth_run_tests_fast_medium_20250930T014103Z.txt†L1-L200】
- Restored CLI UX safeguards for long-running progress timelines and logging by adding deterministic fast regressions for alias rebinding, ETA formatting, failure diagnostics, and redaction-aware structured handlers.【F:tests/unit/application/cli/commands/test_long_running_progress_timeline_bridge.py†L1-L281】【F:tests/unit/logging/test_logging_setup.py†L701-L874】【F:src/devsynth/application/cli/long_running_progress.py†L402-L615】【F:src/devsynth/logging_setup.py†L1-L429】

### Known Issues (Alpha Release)
- Minor import issue in `tests/unit/interface/webui/test_rendering.py` (non-critical)
- Some optional dependencies may require manual installation for full functionality
- Documentation may contain some references to unreleased features

### Migration Notes
This is the first published alpha release. No migration from previous versions is required as this represents the initial public milestone.

Initial alpha release delivering a modular architecture, unified memory backends, and a LangGraph-powered agent system.

### Highlights
- Aligned versioning with PEP 440 and standardized `0.1.0a1` across code and docs.
- Release automation stabilized; `task release:prep` runs locally and in CI (dry-run).
- Test runner stabilized with safe defaults and deterministic provider stubs; CLI entrypoint resolution fixed.
- Pre-commit/dev toolchain reliability improved; circular import in reasoning fixed.
- Verification scripts for markers and release state streamlined and documented.

### Breaking Changes
- CLI command renames:
  - `adaptive` → `refactor`
  - `analyze` → `inspect`
  - `run` → `run-pipeline`
  - `replay` → `retrace`
  Update any scripts or automation that reference old commands.

### Added
- Documented acceptance criteria for MVU command execution with linked BDD feature coverage.
- Modular, hexagonal architecture
- Unified memory system with multiple backends
- Agent system powered by LangGraph
- Advanced code analysis using NetworkX
- Provider abstraction for LLM services
- Comprehensive SDLC policy corpus
- Automated documentation and testing
- Recursive EDRR framework implementation
- Documentation cleansing and organization
- Behavior-driven tests for the EDRR coordinator
- Basic security utilities for authentication, authorization, and input sanitization
- Doctor command for configuration validation
- Anthropic API support and deterministic offline provider implementation
- MVUU engine for tracking Minimum Viable Utility Units
- Atomic-Rewrite workflow for granular commit generation

- Documentation cross-references linking issues and BDD features for Code Analysis, Complete Sprint-EDRR integration, Complete memory system integration, Critical recommendations follow-up, Enhance retry mechanism, Expand test generation capabilities, Finalize WSDE/EDRR workflow logic, Finalize dialectical reasoning, Improve deployment automation, Integrate dialectical audit into CI, Multi-Agent Collaboration, Multi-Layered Memory System, Resolve pytest-xdist assertion errors, Review and Reprioritize Open Issues, and User Authentication.

### Changed
- Moved development documents to appropriate locations in the docs/ directory
- Consolidated DevSynth analysis documents
- Updated cross-references in documentation
- Renamed CLI commands: `adaptive`→`refactor`, `analyze`→`inspect`, `run`→`run-pipeline`, `replay`→`retrace`
- Synchronized feature status reports with latest implementation
- Stabilized pre-release references to maintain version `0.1.0a1` across configuration and documentation
- Updated documentation to reflect implementation of WebUI, CLI overhaul,
  hybrid memory architecture, and basic metrics system.

### Deprecated
- `scripts/alignment_check.py` and `scripts/validate_manifest.py` replaced by
  CLI commands `devsynth align` and `devsynth validate-manifest`. These scripts
  will be removed in v1.0 per the deprecation policy.

### Fixed
- Improved error handling in the EDRR coordinator
- EDRR coordinator emits sync hooks even when memory management is unavailable or flush operations fail
- Optional tiktoken dependency no longer breaks Kuzu memory initialization
- Added missing step definitions for enhanced memory scenarios
- Linked remaining alpha tasks (WebUI, Kuzu memory, WSDE collaboration, CLI ingestion) to milestone `0.1.0-alpha.1` and updated development status.
- Memory module import no longer leaves residual TinyDB state when the dependency is absent
- TinyDBMemoryAdapter converts non-JSON types (e.g., sets, datetimes) during serialization to avoid TypeError
- Seeded WSDE/EDRR simulation for deterministic convergence and added sentinel speed test

### Dialectical audit
- Generated `dialectical_audit.log`; see Issue 125 for unresolved questions.

### Known P1 Issues and Test Gaps
- Some performance and GUI-related tests are gated and may be skipped in minimal CI jobs.
